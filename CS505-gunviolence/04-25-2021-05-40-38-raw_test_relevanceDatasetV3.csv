One day last fall I went to shoot at a different gun range And there on the counter was a flier with a scary photo of Hillary Clinton informing patrons that if elected she would trample on their Second Amendment rights Shortly after the election I got a letter from the NRA declaring grimly Our worst nightmare is staring us right in the face Obviously the mailing was done on the assumption that Clinton would win and that hysteria was still a sound operating plan,gunrights hysteria doesnt sell in the trump era And thats a problem because so many of these people are already under indictment for conspiracy and for lying about what could be in the White Houses plan Its worth noting that Obamas health care bill is supposed to eliminate the socalled insurance mandate the health insurance requirement that keeps people covered even if they dont get health insurance Obama has consistently said that the mandate should be eliminated because it restricts affordable,a gun shop in san francisco I was in love with a gun shop in San Francisco It was the only gun shop in the city and I had always wanted to buy one In my husband called and asked me where we were We had decided to buy a couple of things from somebody else and we thought we would have about a year to make it in San Francisco One of us got a new two year old gun that he had bought a few years ago and,0

The Broward school district mishandled the case of student Nikolas Cruz when he asked for special help long before he killed staff and students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School according to a longawaited report released Friday For the first time the report revealed that Cruz had asked to return to the districts special education program which would have provided him more support than he received as a general student the report says The report by the Collaborative Educational Network of Tallahassee found that the school district largely followed the policies and laws in place when educating Cruz but failed on two occasions Exactly how is not clear Broward Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer ruled Friday that the page report could be released to the public but much of the content was blacked out apparently including any details that would explain the districts mistakes The Broward school district recommended the report be altered to comply with the shooters educational and medical privacy rights Advertisement Of the reports lines of them or about are concealed After rejecting special education Cruz quickly failed Three days after he was forced by the district to withdraw from the Parkland school he purchased an AR A year after his ejection he returned and gunned down students and three adults Cruzs attorneys argued unsuccessfully in court that the report would hinder his right to a fair trial Scherer agreed with attorneys for the South Florida Sun Sentinel and other media outlets who argued the taxpayerfunded report should not be hidden from view In a written statement Broward Schools Supt Robert Runcie said he looked forward to releasing the full report as soon as it is legally appropriate He said the review shows that the districts systems are appropriate and that the district worked consistently to provide an education and ongoing changing behavioral care for Cruz throughout his time in the Broward school system Advertisement The report however suggests the district did not follow laws or policies in place when school employees tried to transfer Cruz then a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas to a special education campus Cruz then refused and removed himself from the special education program Runcie has said that when Cruz made that decision the district was unable to help him with special education services But the consultants report reveals for the first time that Cruz later requested reinstatement of special education services and the district mishandled his request The revelation bolsters criticism from some special education experts who said the district should have done more for Cruz who had emotional and behavioral problems Advertisement Cruzs attorneys said the report is a whitewash commissioned by the school district to clear it of responsibility for how it handled Cruzs complex psychological problems I think that the report is an attempt by the school board to absolve itself of any liability or responsibility for all the missed opportunities that they had in this matter said Gordon Weekes the chief assistant public defender The consultant however found that the district largely handled Cruz properly over years of education With isolated exceptions the district adhered to procedural and substantive requirements the report says Advertisement Without directly criticizing the school district the consultant recommended the district reconsider how to handle cases like Cruzs where a highneeds special education student decides against participating in special education and then reverses the decision The report suggests that when Cruz was a general education student he wasnt offered access to counseling and mental health services that are available to all students McMahon and Wallman write for the South Florida SunSentinel UPDATES Advertisement pm This article was updated to say a longawaited report found Broward County Public Schools mishandled the case of Nikolas Cruz This article was originally published at pm,florida school failed parkland shooter report says Police Chief James M Lombardi says he doesnt think theres any evidence linking Michael Brown to any recent shootings but he does agree with police that the suspect fired a number of shots after being killed including one that struck a security guard It wasnt so much an accidental discharge that killed him there was a lot of bleeding there was a lot of bodily injuries Lombardi said Monday adding that,nikolas cruz in a photo from social media He took no part in this shoot Photo courtesy Gravitas,0

Despite all the talk about arming teachers after the Parkland FL mass shooting in February most educators remain opposed to guns in their classrooms But the idea doesnt seem to fade away The New York Timesreported on Thursday morning that the Department of Education is considering letting states use federal funding to buy guns for teachers This would reverse a longstanding government position and go against Congress efforts to restrict use of federal funding on firearms In March legislators passed a school safety bill to fund school security but prohibited using any portion of it for weapons although it did not include any gun control measures either The Education Department is reportedly considering the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants program which makes no mention of prohibiting funding for guns This means Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos could decide to approve this type of funding for states or districts unless Congress takes action If the proposal is carried out this would be the first time a federal agency authorises purchasing weapons without a congressional mandate according to the Times sources It seems obscene to use money meant to be used for education to buy guns A senior administration official pushed back to clarify the Times reporting to CNN saying that the idea did not actually originate with the Education Department The official said the department had received a letter from the Texas Department of Education asking whether funds from a federal grant program could be used to purchase guns for teachers and administrators After lawyers and attorneys reviewed the letter the Education Department chose not to respond The department is constantly considering and evaluating policy issues particularly issues related to school safety Liz Hill a spokesperson for the Education Department said in a statement The secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios DeVos does however think Congress should clarify whether the federal government can grant states funding to buy guns the official told CNN The proposal has been highly controversial ever since Trump floated it in the days after Parkland Most US teachers echoed by administrators and education experts oppose carrying guns in schools According to a Gallup poll from March done just a few weeks after the Florida shooting do not support the idea And say carrying guns in schools would make schools less safe Only would be willing to carry a gun at school Additionally the National Education Association polled of its members and said they oppose being armed Refinery has spoken with several teachers on the subject and there are varied concerns Some bring up that guns could get into the wrong hands Others dont think teachers being armed would protect students from a potential shooter but rather make them more vulnerable to getting caught in a crossfire Still others say states and school districts need to focus on funding education not firearms As teachers scramble to buy things for their classrooms and schools juggle to prioritise their needs because there is not enough money to get what is needed it seems obscene to use money meant to be used for education to buy guns Robin Farber Latin teacher and student government advisor at a public high school in North Carolina told Refinery I hope that Congress will close the loopholes that would allow DeVos to manipulate funds like this Some states already allow teachers to be armed while several have introduced legislation to do so But still the opposition runs deep The overwhelming majority of teachers oppose being armed Mary Kusler senior director for the National Education Associations Center for Advocacy told CNN Teachers want to be in their classrooms to teach their childrenit is incredibly hard to do that when youre packing heat Like what you see How about some more R goodness right here Mother Accused of Killing of Her Children Released From Prison How Will Michael Cohen Paul Manaforts Legal Drama Impact Trump Nail Salon Brawls Boycotts Unpacking The BlackAsian Conflict In America,reminder us teachers still dont want to carry guns because of the Second Amendment The Supreme Court may never be able to rule on those issues but the courts will they say decide whether the Second Amendment has been violated The Supreme Court has held that Americans must be able to stand up with their lawabiding conscience over laws that promote violence and hatred even after the fact Now in its own historical moment the court is once again showing that the Second Amendment may not,a student at a florida high school in february There is a huge fear over there Vigdor explained that its going to be a suicide bomber I was at a high school about am this morning and thats why my house is in a different kind of state And the people at my place think theyre going to get killed by these kind of people The students who live by the fountain say this,1
Court Rules Second Amendment Doesnt Protect AR Assault Rifles and LargeCapacity Magazines By Ryan Sit On at PM A federal court ruled on Friday that AR rifles the highpowered rifle used in the Parkland mass shooting as well as similar militarystyle rifles and high capacity magazines are not protected under the Second Amendment ARs and large capacity magazines are most useful in military service they are beyond the scope of the Second Amendment and may be banned wrote Massachusetts District Court Judge William Young The case was first brought in January by several gun owners the nonprofit group Gun Owners Action League and gun stores On Target Training and Overwatch Outpost The plaintiffs filed the lawsuit after Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey put gun dealers and manufacturers on notice that her office would begin enforcing the states assault weapons ban that prohibited copies or duplicates of AR and AK rifles Healy issued that notice in June days after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando Florida where a gunman armed with a militarystyle rifle killed peoplethe second deadliest mass shooting in modern American history Healey who was named as a defendant in the case lauded Youngs decision in a statement on Friday vowing that her office will not be intimidated by the gun lobby Semiautomatic ARs are for sale at Good Guys Guns Range on February in Orem Utah On April the Massachusetts District Court ruled that ARstyle rifles are not protected under the Second Amendment George FreyGetty Images Todays decision upholding the Assault Weapons Ban vindicates the right of the people of Massachusetts to protect themselves from these weapons of war and my offices efforts to enforce the law Healey said in a statement Strong gun laws save lives and we will not be intimidated by the gun lobby in our efforts to end the sale of assault weapons and protect our communities and schools Families across the country should take heart in this victory This the latest in a long line of decisions holding that commonsense gun laws are completely compatible with the Second Amendment Eric Tirschwell director of litigation at Everytown for Gun Safety told Newsweek in an emailed statement Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now More than ARstyle rifles were sold in Massachusetts in but since Healey issued her enforcement notice sales have virtually ended her office said Young cited several prominent cases in his decision most notably the landmark Supreme Court case District of Columbia v Heller The case upheld that individuals could own firearms but noted several limitations to the Second Amendment Writing for the majority in the Heller decision the late Justice Antonin Scalia clarified Like most rights the Second Amendment right is not unlimited It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose RELATED Trump Vows Second Amendment Will Never Be Repealed After Former Supreme Court Justice Called For the Change Young called Scalias majority writing a tour de force on the Second Amendment Critically Young wrote that Scalia explained that weapons that are most useful in military serviceM rifles and the like are not protected under the Second Amendment The AR and the M were designed and manufactured simultaneously for the military and share very similar features and functions Young wrote Therefore because the undisputed facts convincingly demonstrate that ARs and large capacity magazines are most useful in military service they are beyond the scope of the Second Amendment The plaintiffs also citing the Heller case argued that arms in common use for lawful purposes like selfdefense are protected under the Second Amendment The AR they noted and similarly styled weapons are among the most popular rifles in the country today Yet the ARs present day popularity is not constitutionally material Young wrote The test is not the ARs present day popularity but whether it is a weapon most useful in military service The AR and its analogs along with large capacity magazines are simply not weapons within the original meaning of the individual constitutional right to bear Arms Young wrote in his conclusion Massachusetts is free to ban these weapons and large capacity magazines Other states are equally free to leave them unregulated and available to their lawabiding citizens he continued Americans are not afraid of bumptious raucous and robust debate about these matters We call it democracy Justice Scalia would be proud Young wrote,court rules second amendment doesnt protect ar assault rifles and largecapacity magazines If the Legislature changes the law I think this would be an odd move for the government of Maryland where a bill restricting concealed

By Jon Herskovitz AUSTIN Texas Reuters Texas political leaders are considering installing airportstyle security at public schools and screening students for mental health issues as alternatives to gun control to thwart a repeat of last weeks deadly shooting at a Houstonarea high school The focus on school security and mental health has emerged since the shooting because Republican Governor Greg Abbott is facing few calls to overhaul gun laws in a state where the majority of the electorate backs gun ownership The governors office said he would hold roundtable discussions from Tuesday to focus on the best options Eight students and two teachers were killed when a yearold student opened fire at Santa Fe High School last week in the latest mass shooting at a US school Craig Bessent an assistant superintendent of the Wylie Independent School District in Abilene said in an interview that he will take part in the roundtable and that he favored more police or security officers and more screening of students as they entered school campuses He also supports arming some teachers as a good first line of defense a position that President Donald Trump has advocated Theres not just the one thing you can do that will stop this and be a cureall Bessent said Theres not a single answer The shooting at Santa Fe High School occurred about three months after teenagers and staff were shot dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida stoking the national debate over gun control About twothirds of Texas Republicans believe if more people carried guns the state would be safer according to a statewide survey in late from the University of Texas and Texas Tribune The shooting rampage in Florida sparked a gun control campaign by students and parents that has piled on pressure nationwide for lawmakers to enact gun control legislation Texas Republicans look at this tragedy and they do not see the gun as the problem said Mark Jones a political science professor at Rice University in Houston They see the person as the problem and security as the second problem Story continues One of the states most prominent Republican leaders Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said he wanted to limit entrances to schools and stagger class starting times to allow for searches He acknowledged that such airportstyle screening would carry a high cost for the thousands of school districts in the state The Republicancontrolled legislature is out of session until January making it nearly impossible for the state to implement and fund any major changes that come out of this weeks three roundtable discussions The roundtables are more political theater than anything else Jones said The governor has said he sees the roundtables as an essential step in coming up with a consensus approach to enhance school safety He did not respond to a request for comment Political analysts said if Abbott wanted to implement changes already floated such as adding more metal detectors in schools and allowing for court orders to remove firearms from a person who presents a danger he would call for a special legislative session Abbott has given no indication that he would do so Texas has million students enrolled in its public schools and any changes it made statewide would be costly One program being run out of Texas Tech University in Lubbock to screen students who could harm themselves or others has Abbotts attention He said after the shooting that he wanted to use it across the state The program trains people using FBI threatassessment criteria to go to schools and screen students according to Billy Philips an epidemiologist and director of the Office of Rural Health at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center About students have been screened through the program according to data provided by Texas Tech About percent of them were referred to licensed counselors Roughly about a third of those that were triaged were for suicidal intention and theyre mostly female females act in males act out Phillips said Before the shooting at Santa Fe High School Texas Democrats had filed about bills related to gun violence almost all of which died when the legislative session ended last year They included measures to buy back guns improve gun safety education and create a lethal violence protective order to stop a potentially dangerous person from buying or possessing a firearm Reporting by Jon Herskovitz in Austin Texas Additional reporting by Jonathan Allen in New York Rich McKay in Atlanta Liz Hampton and Erwin Seba in

LAS VEGAS AP The marquees on the glimmering Las Vegas Strip dimmed their lights for three minutes Monday night as officials slowly read the names of the people killed one year earlier in the countrys deadliest mass shooting in modern history The names of the slain were recited before a silent crowd punctuated by sobs shortly after pm nearly the exact time months earlier that a gunman in a tower suite at the Mandalay Bay casinoresort opened fire on the crowd of Rick Barnette whose yearold daughter Carrie was one of those killed sobbed and looked at the sky Monday as the names were read He wore a Tshirt with a picture of his daughter on it Its really hard Every night when I go to bed I think about her Every day Barnette said after the ceremony They say you get over it I dont think you can get over it The ceremony ended a somber day of events reuniting survivors and the family members of those killed at last years country music festival Jane Matusz of San Diego who had attended the festival with friends said memories of the Oct shooting returned Monday as she attended memorial events in Las Vegas There is something very comforting about being with other survivors and family members she said Its a very strange club to be a part of Hours earlier victims families survivors and elected officials marked the anniversary of the tragedy by placing roses on a tribute wall and dedicating a downtown memorial garden The dedication ceremony under a cloudstreaked orange sunset drew at least people including former US Rep Gabby Giffords of Arizona herself a survivor of a mass shooting The garden which features a tree for each of the victims and an oak that represents life is the only permanent public space that has been created as a memorial to the shooting It was built by volunteers and created days after the shooting as the communitys way of reacting to the searing violence according to the projects cocreator Story continues Weve pushed back with a very deliberate act of compassion Jay Pleggenkuhle said The city known for its gambling and entertainment started the tributes Monday with a sunrise ceremony where a flock of doves were released with each bird bearing a leg band with the name of one of the people slain Today we remember the unforgettable Today we comfort the inconsolable Nevada Gov Brian Sandoval told several hundred survivors families of victims firstresponders and elected officials who gathered at the dawn ceremony at an outdoor amphitheater He added Today we are reminded of the pain that never really goes away The festival venue that became a killing ground has not been used in the year since the shooting MGM Resorts International the owner of the property and Mandalay Bay hotel has not said if or when it will reopen On Monday night hundreds of survivors of the shooting formed a human chain around the shuttered site linking arms and hands to show solidarity Nearby a procession of pickup trucks with American flags flying from their truck beds drove the Strip while honking their horns Many who were cheering Jason Aldeans headline set on at the Route Harvest Festival late Oct said later they thought the rapid crackcrackcrack they heard was fireworks until people fell dead wounded bleeding From across Las Vegas Boulevard a gamblerturnedgunman with what police later called a meticulous plan but an unknown reason fired assaultstyle rifles for minutes from ndfloor windows of the Mandalay Bay hotel into the concert crowd below Police said he then killed himself Medical examiners later determined that all deaths were from gunshots Another people were wounded and police said at least were injured fleeing the carnage Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo declared the police investigation finished in August issuing a report that said hundreds of interviews and thousands of hours of investigative work could not provide answers to what made Stephen Craig Paddock unleash his hail of gunfire That has left unanswered the question of why a yearold former accountant real estate investor small plane pilot and highlimit video poker player assembled his arsenal and attacked the concert crowd Paddock was characterized by police as a loner with no religious or political affiliations who became obsessed with guns spent more than million in the two years before the shooting and distanced himself from his girlfriend and family Paddocks gambling habits made him a soughtafter casino patron Over several days Mandalay Bay employees readily let him use a service elevator to take suitcases to the pernight suite he had been provided for free The room had a commanding view of the Strip and the Route Harvest Festival concert grounds across the street After breaking out windows Paddock fired shots in minutes police have said Jim Murren the chief executive and CEO of MGM Resorts International issued a statement calling the shooting an unforgettable act of terror Oct will forever be a day of remembrance reflection

President Trump said that the suspect responsible for killing and injuring multiple people and police officers at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday should get the death penalty saying the suspect should pay the ultimate price Speaking to reporters ahead of boarding Air Force One Trump addressed the devastating shooting that occurred Saturday morning at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburghs Squirrel Hill neighborhood which is predominantly Jewish Multiple fatalities were reported and there were also injuries including four police officers People who do this should get the death penalty Trump said I think they should stiffen up laws and I think they should very much bring the death penalty to anybody who does a thing like this to innocent people He added They should really suffer the ultimate price pay the ultimate price Ive felt this way for a very long time People disagree with me and I cant imagine why Later Saturday the president ordered that flags be flown at halfstaff at federal buildings in solemn respect for the synagogue shooting victims Earlier this month the president called for the death penalty to be brought against criminals who kill police officers The president has issued calls for a stricter death penalty policy since the presidential campaign The death penalty is legal in Pennsylvania though current Gov Tom Wolf halted the process when he took office in The last person executed under the death penalty in Pennsylvania was in the first since Trump was asked about tighter gun laws which he discounted saying they had little to do with it If they had protection inside the results would have been far better If they had some kind of protection inside the temple maybe it could have been a very much different situation Trump said They didnt have protection They had a maniac walk in and they didnt have any protection He added If there was an armed guard inside the temple they would have been able to stop him Maybe there would have been nobody killed except for him frankly Trump continued Isnt it a shame that you have to think of that inside a temple or inside a church But certainly the result would have been far better The presidents comments were among the multitude of reactions from leaders on Saturday as the story continued to develop Those reactions ranged from solemn expressions of sympathy to angry denunciations of divisive rhetoric and urgent calls for action House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer DMd said he was horrified by the shooting but criticized the presidents suggestion to have armed guards in houses of worship The Presidents suggestion that Americans need to worship under armed guard is absurd Hoyer said in a statement We must address the ease by which someone can obtain the most dangerous weapons of war and use them to commit mass violence in this country The president added that the world is a violent world You think when youre over it it just goes away Trump said But then it comes back in the form of a madmana whacko Trump added that prior to taking office he watched instances like this calling it a shame But its even tougher when youre the president of the United States Trump said You have to watch this kind of a thing happen and its so sad to see Trump tweeted earlier Saturday morning saying the events in Pittsburgh were far more devastating than originally thought adding that he spoke with Mayor and Governor to inform them that the Federal Government has been and will be with them all the way The presidents daughter Ivanka Trump who converted to the Orthodox Jewish faith with her husband Jared Kushner condemned the events America is stronger than the acts of a depraved bigot and antisemite All good Americans stand with the Jewish people to oppose acts of terror share the horror disgust outrage over the massacre in Pittsburgh We must unite against hatred evil God bless those affected Ivanka Trump tweeted Vice President Pence also tweeted praying for the fallen while counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway called the event horrifying White House press secretary Sarah Sanders also reacted saying she is Saddened and appalled by the cowardly act of evil committed at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh We stand in total solidarity with the victims and all of the Jewish community against bigotry and hate First lady Melania Trump also tweeted saying that the violence needs to stop My heart breaks over the news out of The violence needs to stop May God bless guide unite the United States of America Also issuing a strongly worded condemnation of the shooting Saturday afternoon was House Speaker Paul Ryan RWis who like so many others voiced disgust and dismay over the bloodshed and racist overtones This morning a solemn celebration of life and faith turned to horror and chaos We are deeply devastated by this tragedy the roots of which appear to be especially repulsive Ryan said in his statement The sickening reality is that antiSemitism in America continues to rear its ugly head It is an ideology of hate that must be eradicated wherever it may surface This is a time to mourn and heal but also to reaffirm that we will not tolerate this bigotry Others like US Sen Chris Murphy DConn chided politicians for feeding divisions in society with their rhetoric We cannot continue down this path something must change his statement read Certainly our loose gun laws are to blame but we are also dealing with a much more insidious problem Access to online cesspools of racial and religious hatred comes too easily today and too often

Florida Gov Rick Scott R on Friday proposed spending half a billion dollars to boost school security and mental health care funding in hopes of preventing shootings like the massacre at a Parkland Fla high school that claimed lives last week Notably the governors plan would raise the age to purchase all firearms to which is in direct opposition to the National Rifle Associations stance on firearm purchases Current Florida law requires those purchasing handguns to be but residents as young as can still purchase rifles like the one used by the Parkland shooter ADVERTISEMENT Scotts plan would also create a new system to identify and prevent violent or mentally ill people from purchasing or possessing a gun if family members or law enforcement officers show evidence to a court It would also restrict gun purchases or possession by those who have been involuntarily committed to a hospital Scott also called on the state legislature to implement criminal penalties for threats to schools made on social media And he wants the legislature to ban bump stocks the modification that allows a semiautomatic weapon to shoot more rapidly This is a time when I believe we must all come together and even cross party lines Scott told reporters at a news conference in Tallahassee Of course we wont all agree on every issue but I do believe this is a moment when our state can come together around a commonsense set of actions The proposal seems to be in line with many of the thoughts President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump says he would be comfortable sending son grandchildren to school in person Cafeteria worker on White House grounds tests positive for COVID reports Republicans to start unveiling coronavirus package Thursday MORE has expressed since the shooting The president has called for stronger backgrounds checks raising the age to purchase a gun to and a ban on bump stocks Trump has also floated the idea of arming teachers as a way to deter wouldbe attackers a plan that Scott has said he does not endorse Scott asked the legislature to appropriate million for stronger school safety measures including an initiative to place at least one law enforcement officer in every public school The money would also pay for mandatory active shooter training and drills to be held twice a year for both faculty and students The package of legislation would include a new statewide hotline that would allow students or teachers to report suspect behavior And it would provide dedicated mental health counselors at every school Some will say its too much and some will say its not enough Scott said of his proposals Scott also called for million in funding for expanded mental health service teams to treat early or serious mental illness through counseling and crisis management Despite the difference on age restrictions Scott is a close ally of the NRA and on Friday affirmed he would resist calls to roll back gun rights I know there are some who are advocating a mass takeaway of Second Amendment rights for all Americans That is not the answer Scott said Keeping guns away from dangerous people and people with mental health issues is what we need to do Gun control groups are not likely to be mollified by the steps Scott outlined Friday The state legislature earlier this week voted down a package of gun control measures backed by groups like Everytown for Gun Safety even as students from Parkland watched in the gallery More funding for school security could be good but what we want is background checks red flag laws and National Instant Criminal Background Check System denial legislation said Jamie Ito a Tallahassee lawyer who works with Moms Demand Action a group that advocates for stricter gun controls Florida has among the most permissive gun laws in the nation and more than a million state residents have a concealed carry permit Even modest reforms to Floridas gun laws are likely to face stiff headwinds in the Republicancontrolled state legislature where many members are already eyeing runs for higher office Legislators only have a short window to act on Scotts proposals This years session is scheduled to end March ,florida governor bucks nra on age restrictions in new gun proposal Read more Were not trying to hurt the state of Florida at all said state senator Phil Mendenhall a Democrat who sponsored the measure last month Our goal is to encourage our residents to come out to town to vote to protect our community But it is Florida that has decided to legalize recreational marijuana which has surged in popularity in Florida in recent years The last time a Florida Democrat,gov rick scott of florida After you have created a new instance of the app you can add the new one to the configuration file in the AppStore The new instance must be at least If you want to replace all of the apps that you have created set the config value to For example appname examplecom applicationname examplecom,0
Its too early to say for sure but it could be that the free market will wind up doing what Congress refuses to do tighten access to firearms and stand up to companies that make and sell assaultstyle weapons Bank of America announced last week that it will no longer finance companies that make the kinds of combatstyle semiautomatic rifles that have been used to such deadly effect in mass shootings Last month Citigroup Inc announced that it would prohibit clients using its financial services and credit cards from selling firearms to customers who have not passed a background check or who are younger than even when neither of those things are required by law It also now refuses to do business with clients who sell bump stocks the device the Las Vegas sniper used to convert his semiautomatic rifles into ersatz machine guns and highcapacity magazines Those banking sector moves followed policy changes among some major retailers such as Walmart and Dicks Sporting Goods to end sales of some guns in their stores and tighten restrictions on sales of others There is no persuasive argument against universal background checks yet the spineless leaders in Congress refuse to take action The immediate genesis of all this of course was the Valentines Day slaughter of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students and staff members in Parkland Fla the furious backlash by the survivors through social and traditional media and the ensuing nationwide March for Our Lives rallies last month that drew hundreds of thousands of protesters The massacre and public response also have led some state and local governments to tighten controls on certain weapons and buyers Advertisement But Congress remains stuck in the gun lobbys thoughts and prayers mode which is why its heartening to see some major banks and retailers taking action whether the moves are born of a humanitarian impulse or a recognition that being too close to firearms can be bad for business or some combination of the two Next week students around the nation will lead another public protest the National School Walkout to commemorate the April Columbine school massacre in Colorado in which people were killed That mass shooting was in retrospect the beginning of the current wave of violent attacks on schools often by students themselves and often using semiautomatic firearms In normal times responsible adults would argue against kids cutting classes but these are far from normal times So we hope this next round of antigun and antiviolence protests is even more successful than the March for Our Lives and that it increases pressure on elected officials to shake loose of the grip of the gun lobby and adopt sensible gun controls That should begin with a renewed ban on assaultstyle weapons Guns designed for or patterned after weapons of war have no place in civilian hands Universal background checks which would stop guns from changing hands without verification that the receiver is eligible to own a firearm are clearly constitutional and help reduce access to firearms by people even the NRA thinks ought not have them There is no persuasive argument against universal background checks yet the spineless leaders in Congress refuse to take action Advertisement The best proposal Congress has come up with is the socalled Fix NICS bill a good measure that would put more weight behind existing requirements that federal agencies report to the national database the names of people ineligible to own a gun and provide money to entice more states to do the same because of the division between federal and state responsibilities state reporting to the federal system is voluntary But even if it were to pass Fix NICS would still be a baby step Meanwhile a bill that would require all states to recognize any other states concealedcarry permit has passed the House though in the wake of the Parkland shooting it hasnt gained traction in the Senate This is an extreme and dangerous proposal that would undermine states ability to set their own restrictions on who gets to walk around armed There must be an accounting at the ballot box for Congress failure to attend to act on such a critical public safety issue as gun control In the meantime its good that two banks have acted and we hope to see more banks retailers and others that intersect with the gun industry make similar decisions Guns may be legal but that doesnt wash the blood of the slain from the hands of those who manufacture and prosper from firearms Advertisement Follow the Opinion section on Twitter or Facebook,big banks take a stand against the gun industry And that should be no surprise Guns and gun violence are on the rise in America and in particular among minorities who are poor and

Much of the focus surrounding the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court has been on his views on abortion health care and presidential power and impeachment But with his confirmation hearing in the Senate next week people should be deeply concerned about his troubling position on firearms and the Second Amendment Unlike some other constitutional questions we do not have to guess how Judge Kavanaugh would approach challenges to gun regulations because he laid out his views in a dissenting opinion in a case known as Heller II Those views are outside the mainstream of judicial thought about the Second Amendment If they prevail on the Supreme Court they threaten to invalidate a wide range of some of the most important and effective gun safety regulations at the federal state and local levels ADVERTISEMENT To determine whether a gun law is constitutional Judge Kavanaugh asks only one question Is the law sufficiently rooted in text history and tradition In other words if a gun regulation is longstanding or analogous to a longstanding regulation Judge Kavanaugh would likely uphold it If not he would likely strike it down What this means is that to Judge Kavanaugh all that seems to matter under the Second Amendment is what happened in the past The sole question he asks precludes any consideration by the court of the impact a gun law would have on public safety Judge Kavanaugh is upfront about this and states that his approach rules out any examination of costs and benefits in the dissenting opinion Judge Kavanaugh claims that this extremely narrow Second Amendment methodology is mandated by the landmark decision in District of Columbia v Heller which recognized an individual right of law abiding and responsible citizens to have a gun in the home for selfdefense But no other court has read Heller the way Judge Kavanaugh does His own colleagues on the District of Columbia Circuit have criticized his interpretation as nowhere suggested by the Supreme Court decision One conservative legal commentator has explained that it is a flawed analysis based on a misreading of Heller Instead the consensus among the lower courts including all federal appeals courts to consider it is to also ask whether and how much a gun law contributes to public safety today Under the very different and purely historical approach of Judge Kavanaugh many critical measures to combat gun violence would be at risk We already know from his dissenting opinion in Heller II that Judge Kavanaugh would strike down prohibitions on ARs and other assaultstyle weapons like those used in Parkland Las Vegas Orlando Newtown Aurora and so many other deadly mass shootings We also know that he refused to join his fellow judges who voted to uphold the District of Columbias prohibition on large capacity magazines If Judge Kavanaugh becomes a Supreme Court Justice his approach to the Second Amendment could also call into question a number of other important gun safety measures of relatively recent vintage including red flag laws which empower family members and law enforcement to seek a court order temporarily restricting access to guns when a person poses a danger to self or others domestic violence restraining order laws that disarm domestic abusers and prohibit them from owning firearms and even laws requiring criminal background checks on all gun sales Simply put Judge Kavanaugh represents a dangerous view of the Second Amendment that puts gun rights above the public safety of Americans That is not what we need from our next Supreme Court justice Eric Tirschwell a former federal prosecutor is director of litigation and national enforcement policy at Everytown for Gun Safety,if we want gun safety in america brett kavanaugh will not help us The story goes that the state senator did not believe the Second Amendment was part of his campaign according to a report in The Wall Street Journal in early June so he did not have the states constitutional right to hold handguns I thought he should have been held accountable for the Second Amendment right for trying to hold you accountable especially for your assault weapon The Second Amendment was right for someone who,a gun control case in washington She was convicted of conspiracy to commit a capital murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole WUSA Racism and Discrimination In five white police officers were jailed for carrying on a hate crime at an open carrying event by an African American man The incident sparked widespread criticism of the racial inequalities of the city including accusations of racism within the department Violence Against the Minority A study by,1
WASHINGTON AP The White House said Wednesday that the Justice Department did not consult President Donald Trump when it dropped litigation that would have prevented the posting of instructions on how to make Dprinted plastic guns which are illegal to own or assemble White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the Justice Department made a deal without the presidents approval White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the Justice Department made a deal without the presidents approval President Donald Trump has questioned whether his administration should have agreed to allow the plans to be posted online The internal rift came after a federal judge in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order Tuesday to stop the release of blueprints to make the untraceable and undetectable Dprinted plastic guns The company behind the plans Austin Texasbased Defense Distributed had reached a settlement with the federal government in June allowing it to make the plans for the guns available for download on Wednesday Sanders said the president was glad this effort was delayed so he can review the material Sanders added that the administration supports the longstanding law against owning plastic guns The Justice Departments initial action triggered an onslaught of criticism about the possible proliferation of potentially lethal Dprinted weapons Eight Democratic attorneys general had filed a lawsuit Monday seeking to block the settlement They also sought the restraining order arguing the D guns would be a safety risk Congressional Democrats have urged President Donald Trump to reverse the decision to publish the plans The PBS NewsHours John Yang gets an update on D gun printing Trump tweeted Tuesday that he was looking into the idea and said making D plastic guns available to the public doesnt seem to make much sense Trump tweeted that he had spoken with the National Rifle Association about the downloadable directions a Texas company wants to provide for people to make Dprinted guns The guns are made of a hard plastic and are simple to assemble easy to conceal and difficult to trace People can use the blueprints to manufacture plastic guns using a D printer But industry experts have expressed doubts that criminals would go to the trouble since the printers needed to make the guns can cost thousands of dollars the guns themselves tend to disintegrate quickly and traditional firearms are easy to come by Associated Press writer Matthew Daly in Washington contributed to this report,watch justice department didnt consult trump on dprinted guns white house says White House says the DOJ didnt look into it fixwpusgovernmentdidntlookinatdprintedgunswhitehouseindexhtml Tory has now declared his commitment to stop treaty tr,a woman wearing a dprinted gun Then I got angry and threw up on his back She said the man had a gun and tried to shoot him over the phone He told me not to tell anyone Now the girl has to go into another bigger room The next day they told me they had a gun in their bedroom so I went there and had a shot when I saw her It was too loud and I had to call an ambulance,1

Washington CNN On Wednesday afternoon at the White House President Donald Trump held a brainstorming session on gun legislation with members of Congress That wasnt all that unusual After all in the wake of the murders of people at a Florida high school two weeks ago the national debate has centered on what if anything legislators can do about gun violence What was weird about the meeting was that Trump allowed the press to stay and watch as he bantered with Democratic and Republican senators and House members about possible solutions to the current stalemate over what to do on guns The scene made for remarkable television as Trump routinely broke with Republican orthodoxy to push for a comprehensive bill that might deal with strengthening the current background check system and maybe even raising the minimum age to buy certain kinds of semiautomatic weapons It was Trump as the consummate performer keeping everyone on their toes with his unexpected twists and turns It was in the words of Texas Republican Sen John Cornyn fascinating television and surreal I scoured the transcript of the gun session and picked out of Trumps most memorable lines Theyre below in the order he uttered them We can really get there but we have to do it Well Im convinced I see some folks that dont say nice things about me and thats OK So so true Not everyone is going to like you in this life Also one more bit of advice You can pick your friends and you can pick your nose But you cant pick your friends nose If you turn that into this energy Ill love you I dont care I dont care either And I love you too Youve got to have defense too You cant just be sitting ducks This line has emerged as a major part of Trumps views on guns in the last few weeks That arming the good guys is the best way to prevent the bad guys from doing so much damage There is a longrunning and hugely contentious debate as to whether Trumps contention more guns of lawabiding citizens actually prevents or even lessens violence One thing we can all agree on The best defense is a good offense Or something Im looking at a number of the folks around the table and youre working on different bills We have to get them done All of them Im the biggest fan of the Second Amendment Many of you are Im a big fan of the NRA Look a lot of you guys like the NRA But not like I like the NRA OK Believe me I had lunch with them with Wayne and Chris and David on Sunday First name basis We got to stop this nonsense Its time This is a big deal if Trump means it As in is he willing to go against the NRAs priorities and push like hell in the House especially for some more comprehensive gun reforms Certain ideas sound good but theyre not good Like taking your yearold to an indoor skydiving place for his birthday I mean hypothetically speaking of course It would be so beautiful to have one bill that everybody could support as opposed to you know bills everybody has got their own bill Um a few things a so beautiful b Trump is advocating for a comprehensive gun bill here c congressional Republicans would NEVER go for this Its idealistic its wonderful its a beautiful thing Evergreen Trump quote Im going to write the bump stock essentially write it out So you wont have to worry about bump stock This was news to everyone in that room and everyone watching on TV Now Trump has to you know do it Fix NICS has some really good things in it but it would be nice if we could add everything onto it Again this is Trump advocating for a more rather than less comprehensive bill on guns Sit with that And maybe you change the title all right The US background check bill or whatever Trump is big on names and message sending Remember that he was a big advocate for getting tax cuts and jobs in the formal title of the tax bill He also proposed calling it the Cut Cut Cut bill Maybe we could make it much more comprehensive and have one bill instead of different bills that nobody knows whats happening Comprehensive Three times Republican president You went through a lot of Presidents and you didnt get it done You have a different President Remember how much Trump is motivated by his desire to be the first or the best to do something One of the prime drivers of his desire to get something done on guns is that President Barack Obama failed to enact meaningful change into law following the school shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut Its time that a President stepped up and we havent had them See JUST WATCHED Trump Take guns first then go to court Replay More Videos MUST WATCH Trump Take guns first then go to court One bill is nicer than having seven bills And that makes four mentions by a Republican president of his desire to have a more comprehensive bill Number one you can take the guns away immediately from people that you can adjudge easily are mentally ill like this guy Not legally you cant At least not right now Id just like to ask Joe and Pat In your bill what are you doing about the to Trump quizzing Pat Toomey RPennsylvania and Joe Manchin DWest Virginia on their bipartisan bill which failed to make it to a final floor vote in I dont know if I am more surprised that Trump doesnt seem to know the details of the bill or that he is advocating again for potentially raising the age to buy a rifle Actually I am much more surprised at the latter And Im a fan of the NRA I mean theres no bigger fan Im a big fan of the NRA Big fan Biggetybig fan The biggest You know why Because youre afraid of the NRA right Ah ha ha ha ugh This was a Trump jibe at Toomey for not including raising the age to buy a rifle from to in the bipartisan bill It was funny except if you are Pat Toomey I think its a position Its a position Is it a position or not I cant live in the kind of limbo If he knew there was offensive power inside of the events probably none of them would have happened which is an important point for people to understand Again theres lots and lots of conflicting evidence about whether or not good guys with guns either prevent or mitigate mass casualty shooting events Texas as an example is very much as to what Im saying I think that some states are different Fact Check True Its the best weve ever done too By far Its not clear to me from the context what Trump is referring to here But I guess it doesnt matter because whatever it was it was the best ever Big inaudible My favorite line I dont know if its the big or the inaudible Maybe its just how they work together Like peanut butter and chocolate Were going to get it passed Were going to get it passed Narrator voice They might not get it passed Youll never get this passed If you add concealed carry to this youll never get it passed A Republican president telling a member of the House Republican leadership that an element of a gun bill that allows reciprocity for concealandcarry permits is a poison pill for a larger gun bill Remarkable And not wrong The video games the movies the Internet stuff is so violent Its so incredible Agree wholeheartedly Lots of awful stuff that young kids are being exposed to in ways they never were when I was growing up and certainly not when Trump was growing up Some of you people are petrified of the NRA You cant be petrified Trump is right about how some politicians live in fear of the NRA And that fear is justified politically speaking The NRA has lots of legislative and political swat and have shown over the years theyre not afraid to use it Look youre not going to get concealed carry approved A remarkable admission from a Republican president staring at a Republicancontrolled House and a Republicancontrolled Senate Take the guns first go through due process second Well you could do that I mean it would be illegal But you could do it I like that much better having a comprehensive bill I had not heard that before It would really be nice to create something thats beautiful that works I feel like Trump may not totally grasp the definition of the word beautiful I like it together better Same I like a merger because I think the merger works out better Trump Promerger Fox News does a very good job relatively speaking Because of course If we can come up with something thats very strong very heavy with mental illness very heavy and everything Trump requirements regarding mental illness in a gun bill Very strong Very heavy Everything Im not into popularity Im into getting something done thats good Ahem If you could all get together and we could put it in one great piece of legislation If youre counting and I am thats the sixth time a Republican president has pushed for a comprehensive bill on guns in this meeting alone Id rather have you come down on the strong side instead of the weak side To summarize Strong Weak,the most eyepopping lines from donald trumps surreal gathering on guns women and crime But the moment is hard to beat When you listen to the sound of Donald Trump you know every ounce of meaninglessness that comes from the manchild moment in which he declared that were going to build a wall and for several minutes we were listening in shock to the most powerful men in the country speaking out against him And yet Hillary is,president trump and the first lady melania trump at the white house on wednesday Hillary Clinton January She came out strongly against Trumps plans to repeal Obamacare But she said earlier on Monday she has no problem walking away from the White House for being a part of her husbands plan If he wants to do something about it and get elected we will try for that But if that doesnt happen,1

A teen brought two handguns and dozens of rounds of ammunition to school to allegedly kill people in honor of his late father Photo Getty Images Last week a student at Sage Valley Junior High School in Gillette Wyo made headlines after he was arrested for bringing loaded handguns to school Now another classmate the one responsible for blowing the whistle and possibly preventing a deadly school shooting is being hailed a hero A local couple has even expressed thanks by raising funds for the unidentified teen Joel and Andreanna Elbert learned that the unnamed student was hanging out at his locker on Nov when the potential shooter yearold Dale Warner walked down the hall and boldly brandished a caliber handgun He allegedly had two handguns and rounds of ammunition in total on his person and in his locker He told the student who spotted him not to tell anyone Apparently Warner had issued the same warning to three other peers who knew Warner was armed and had even heard him threaten to shoot a student and some staff members because he was unhappy with them said Police Chief Jim Hloucal But those kids chose not to report him because they were scared of what he might do to them or because they thought he wasnt serious about harming people according to the Gillette News Record The teen who wound up saving his school had actually gone to class first in a state of shock after seeing the gun according to the Gillette News Record but quickly had a change of heart and marched to the schools main office to report the gunslinging student to authorities This is a classic case where someone had information that was concerning and did the right thing by reporting to law enforcement and staff right away Hloucal told the news outlet Police were called and immediately put the school on lockdown for minutes as a precaution while conducting an investigation They were able to find and confiscate the firearms and ammunition then interview students who had crucial information about the shooting plot which they said was Warners bizarre way of paying homage to his late father They then took Warner into custody and he has been charged as an adult The teen faces nine counts of attempted firstdegree murder one count for each person he mercilessly threatened to shoot Story continues When they first found out it was a student who busted the wouldbe shooter people all over social media were clamoring for a chance to recognize the anonymous teens so the Elberts stepped up as their daughter is also a student at the school and actually sat across from the shooter in science class They believe a fund is the least they can do for a teen who theoretically saved countless lives Instead of planning Thanksgiving we culd be planning funerals right now Andreanna told Yahoo Lifestyle Something needed to be done to show how grateful we are The fund set up at Campco Federal Credit Union was started with a investment rom Elberts and has snowballed from there The account is still accepting donations call for more information if you care to contribute and Andreanna said she hopes people bombard it with money Once the fundraising has run its course she said she will shut down the account and cut a check to principal at Sage Valley who she will ask to distribute it to the student The couple hope the student will use the cash for something that makes life better because they made all of our lives a lot better Alex Ayers a superintendent for the Campbelly County School District says the schools do have safety measures in place for potential violence like a shooting but theyre not foolproof especially when a student is concealing a weapon He said the teens actions are an example of the most beneficial outcomes of following a refrain common in the

The longsimmering debate over Dprinted guns boiled over again this week but its been clear for a while that something was going to happen In June Dgunprinting pioneer Cody Wilson and his organization Defense Distributed settled a yearslong legal case with the State Department about whether sharing the plans for D printing a gun violated export control laws With that case out of the way Wilson was free to go back to what he was doing in when his organization published the plans for the Liberator the first Dprinted handgun in the world When those plans were first published they were reportedly downloaded more than times in just two days at which time the feds ordered Wilson to take them down But after Wilson followed directions the plans quickly popped up elsewhere online The governments desire to keep the gunprinting plans off the internet backfired Wilson had planned to put new files online Wednesday But early this week lawmakers remembered that Dprinted guns are a thing and started to react in unison Attorneys general from eight states sued the Trump administration to try to keep Wilson from publishing his gun plans again The lawsuit was filed in the federal district court in Seattle with Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson leading the charge On Tuesday a Seattle federal judge issued a nationwide temporary restraining order to prevent Wilson from publishing new gun plans online That injunction however didnt affect the files for Dprinted guns and gun parts that Defense Distributed published days earlier Nor did it cover the booming world of doityourself gunmaking that Wilson has been cashing in on since he was ordered to remove his Dprinting plans off the internet Still lawmakers applauded themselves for stopping Wilson These ghost guns are untraceable virtually undetectable and without todays victory available to any felon domestic abuser or terrorist Ferguson said Tuesday in a statement I hope the President does the right thing and directs his administration to change course On Tuesday morning President Donald Trump weighed in too I am looking into D Plastic Guns being sold to the public he wrote on Twitter Already spoke to NRA doesnt seem to make much sense To be clear no one is talking about selling Dprinted plastic guns which its true doesnt make a lot of sense The debate is about making them And after Trump tweeted members of Congress started to chime in too Trump must say no to the NRA permanently halt D ghost gun designs that enable terrorists criminals to evade detectors tracing Democratic Sen Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said on Twitter Blood will be on the hands of all who fail to act he continued in a subsequent tweet Democratic Sen Edward Markey of Massachusetts tweeted Trump could stop this right now If he doesnt Aug will mark the beginning of a new supercharged era of gun violence he will be directly responsible for it He later tweeted using the hashtag Not catchy but it works Banning files from the internet doesnt make much sense anyway Downloadable gun plans require not only access to a highquality D printer but also enough tech expertise to navigate the process of going from downloading a design to loading it up in software If lawmakers are truly worried about the threat of unregistered firearms they should focus instead on the bustling market of unfinished firearms Theyre commonly called percent lowers in reference to the fact that these kits include guns that are about percent complete but dont constitute a full firearm and therefore dont require a serial number or background check to be sold The market started booming after the call for gun reform following the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland Florida in February and Wilson benefited from that boom In after his Dprintedgun plans were kicked offline though they repopulated shortly afterward he got into the unfinished gun business with Ghost Gunner Ghost Gunner is a milling machine designed specifically for building gun receivers the part of the gun thats regulated and carries a serial number when bought from a licensed gun seller Theyre for sale now on GhostGunnernet for or with a deposit of and a month payment plan Wilson also sells kits of unfinished receivers and parts to build a working AR and handguns The percent and doityourself gun market has been able to blossom within a small loophole of the Gun Control Act of which made it illegal to build a firearm and sell it without a license But the catch is that its legal if you make the firearm and keep itno background check serial number or sellers license needed Doityourself gunmaking has been hard to regulate largely because its hard to regulate componentry and its near impossible to draw the line between a piece of metal that might go into a gun and one that actually does And to make the prospect of regulating DIY guns even harder there are already so many homemade guns out there its almost impossible to know that someone has one unless theres an incident or someone has been stockpiling them to sell The sad fact is that the more gun regulations pass the more athome gunmaking kits sell In California for example its illegal to possess an assault weapon like an AR and Wilson told me in an interview earlier this year that California is his biggest market Despite what lawmakers were saying this week its not clear that Dprinted guns pose a serious threat Plans for printing D weaponry never disappeared from the internet as a result of Wilsons legal challenges and it seems that Dprinted guns dont even work very wellwhen they do work Police in Australia used a highend D printer to make one and when they fired it the gun exploded upon the bullet leaving the chamber People who print guns and try to shoot them might be more likely to blow off their hands than fire multiple bullets If lawmakers are concerned about threats having to do with Dprinted weaponry they might consider banning Dprinted bump stocks too which are attachments that can be added to semiautomatic rifles to make them fire faster Those might work better than a fully Dprinted gun But percent lower kits remain a much bigger threatand should be a higher priority for lawmakers Banning files from the internet doesnt make much sense anyway Digital files can be reproduced with the click of a button Thats how the internet works Lawmakers should know this by now,homemade guns are a much bigger threat than dprinted firearms themselves One of the biggest problems with making your own plastic guns for personal use is that you have to have your own tools and you have to know where to buy them I know I did some shopping online and found some plastic guns that included an electronic firearm which is pretty simple to make However if you want your firearm to be as beautiful as it can be then youll have to learn how to,a dprint gun made by the government In the case of its own creation it had been produced on private farm and was intended as punishment for a crime committed while a citizen in which he was charged with the commission of such crime This second printing was published shortly after The National News magazine at am which was accompanied in that day by printed letters but of a shorter nature which were so published that there was still little time for more,0

Trump immigration and gun rights The panel included three Republicans and three Democrats between the ages of and The three Republicans on the panel were Trump supporter Brittany Christiansen Jessica Barnett who did not vote for President Trump and identifies more as an independent and Colette Forster who voted for the first time in because she wanted to see Mr Trump elected The three Democrats on the panel were Lauren Hughes who voted for Hillary Clinton Jami Amo a lifelong independent who registered as a Democrat in and voted for Clinton and Melissa Alam who first supported Bernie Sanders but voted for Clinton in the general election They all say they plan to vote in Novembers midterms Below are excerpts from their conversation From left to right Brittany Christiansen Jessica Barnett Colette Forster Lauren Hughes Jami Amo and Melissa Alam CBS News Gun control ALEX WAGNER Lets talk about guns Who here owns a gun Lauren Hughes raises her hand What do you think about efforts to promote gun safety reform LAUREN HUGHES Im an attorney and I practice in mental health law as well and I do believe there needs to be some safeguards in place for gun ownership I think you need to dig a little bit deeper whether its into someones mental health history I just think there needs to be a process involved that delves into peoples backgrounds a little further than just whats on the surface of a conviction WAGNER Colette I saw you nodding your head COLETTE FORSTER Yeah I agree with her I think that there should be maybe a mental health check something like that I believe that people should be able to protect themselves their families and their homes But you dont need a semiautomatic weapon to protect yourself Maybe those should be banned BRITTANY CHRISTIANSEN I mean the Second Amendment was put in place because of protecting the citizens from a tyrannical government So if the government has these guns we should have the guns JAMI AMO I mean guys this is my issue You want the machine guns Go for it but please lock them up and please keep the ammunition separate This goes back many times in my life I was years old I was a ninth grader at Columbine High School and I can tell you that it doesnt matter what color the criminal is and what kind of weapon were worried about when that gun is five feet away from you and people that you know are being killed You kind of stop and you think well hey maybe weve gone a little too far with this Maybe there is something we can do But to say that we cant do anything to address anything about the guns is its giving up Its not gonna help anybody its not gonna protect anyone really HUGHES For me its all about can I relate to that person You know gun violence to me is you know what I see on TV But sitting next to someone that has been a victim I can look at it in another you know another way As a guntoting person its not okay when someone like her you know another human being has been through a situation like that WAGNER It sounds like everybody wants us to see each others humanity in all of this right AMO I think thats whats going to bring us back together as a country The political divide WAGNER Do you think millennials are as polarized as the rest of the country MELISSA ALAM Yeah I think we definitely are I think when I personally find out someone voted for Trump I just change my opinion of them right away I actually dont have any Republican friends that I know of so FORSTER Theres a lot of people that wont speak up because when theyre online or they you know post their opinion on social media they are immediately attacked Theyre called a bigot a racist a xenophobe All of those things And those are the worst things you can be called especially when you are not one CHRISTIANSEN So for me I became a Republican when I was years old But it wasnt until Trump that Ive had friends not be friends with me anymore Ive had numerous numerous people come to me privately and they told me that they supported Trump but if I outed them in public they would flat out deny it That theyre literally afraid to speak their minds and they cant believe that I speak my mind Immigration the wall and family separation WAGNER Immigration is very much in the news Who here is in favor of a wall CHRISTIANSEN Walls work You might not like the wall but walls work WAGNER It will cost money CHRISTIANSEN Itll save money by not having the illegals and drugs pouring over the border and having to deal with the repercussions here BARNETT We do want immigrants We want people coming to our nation FORSTER Legal immigration I completely support CHRISTIANSEN And then when you look at the lottery system I mean why are we giving away US citizenship over a lottery We should be doing it meritbased and picking the best and the brightest FORSTER Right you want the best and the brightest to come in You dont want the leftovers WAGNER Let me get your thoughts on some of this I know that Melissa your parents are immigrants ALAM I never saw it as a big deal I thought that this was a country where people would come to you know have a better life My parents came from Bangladesh in the s and I feel like we deserve to be here I thought this was the land of opportunity So to build a wall against other human beings is just not right to me WAGNER What do you think should be done though There are calls on the Democratic side to abolish ICE ALAM I think weve seen enough from these camps that theyre having the separation of families I just Im so appalled at whats happening FORSTER Im a mother I dont believe that the children should be separated from their parents But what theyre doing is you know they would come in here with their child and that way wed catch and release and now we can actually hold them WAGNER What did you think of the family separations policy BARNETT Im not very supportive of it because I dont think it actually achieves the goal of promoting legal immigration I just think its punitive It distracts from the actual calls for true reform,millennial women talk candidly about trump immigration and guns for a chance to be heard in an audience he wants You have to be very

James Alan Fox Opinion columnist Reports that there was an active shooter barricaded inside an Ohio military hospital Thursday sent employees scurrying for safety as teams of first responders rushed to the scene News of the crisis spread quickly throughout the national media and the Twittersphere By the time officials gave the all clear it became apparent that a planned active shooter training exercise had been mistaken for the real thing Although actual active shooter events can be devastating the level of fear associated with this modernday boogeyman is out of control leading to countless false alarms An unfounded report of an active shooter inside a California hospital Wednesday prompted a code black lockdown of the facility and a massive police response An attempted robbery of a jewelry store on July inside a Texas mall created havoc when the sound of breaking glass was mistaken for an active shooter event sending terrified shoppers rushing for the exits As fireworks lit up the sky above Myrtle Beach South Carolina last July Fourth word spread through the crowd that there was an active shooter among them sending thousands running for their lives However there was no shooting and no gunman just folks misinterpreting the sound of firecrackers Satanic cults child abductions by strangers pedophile daycare workers all were at some point considered threats of some magnitude albeit small Yet in classic moral panic fashion frightened Americans overstated the risk and embraced overresponse Of course anyone who sits in a classroom or at his desk at work or who visits a shopping mall or restaurant faces the possibility of confronting an armed assailant But the likelihood is akin to that of being killed by lightning How did we get to the point where the term active shooter a relatively recent addition to our lexicon reflects a menace of intense concern In recent years the FBI has produced a series of reports on active shooter events dispelling a number of common misconceptions For example the latest update indicated that contrary to what many believe active shooters are generally not driven by serious mental illness Moreover they tend to target specific victims as opposed to shooting indiscriminately Are there really more active shooters The FBI statistics remain dubious however in terms of the reported increase over the past two decades which has many observers thinking in epidemic terms According to the FBI database partially assembled by accessing news archives the number of active shooters defined as a gunman actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in populated areas grew from one case in the massacre of seven employees in Wakefield Massachusetts to an average of dozens over the past few years Is the increase in actual cases or in the ability to locate cases from years gone by especially when the press was not so vigilant in reporting on armed assailants who despite their intentions failed to kill lots of people It is hard to fathom that in there was not more than one person in this entire nation who picked up a loaded gun with the desire to kill many people in a public place Actually there was among others a Pittsburgh man who killed five in a hateinspired rampage He just didnt make the FBI database MoreMom of school shooting hero says she would hug the shooters parents After Texas school shooting how can we inoculate ourselves against the next one Danger in overreacting to Santa Fe school shooting In the four years since the FBI began surveying active shooter events percent of assailants failed to kill anyone In the first four years of the FBI database only percent killed no one Either active shooters of recent vintage are poorer marksmen or the less serious cases of earlier years were not identified The other factor driving misperceptions of risk is the overthetop news coverage As in the recent episode at YouTube headquarters as soon as the calls arrive satellite trucks and helicopters are dispatched to the scene transmitting live images into living rooms across America Our fear doesnt match the level of risk As a result the level of fear is well out of proportion with the risk For example a recent poll of residents of Anne Arundel County Maryland found that twothirds feared that an active shooter would strike at a local school Sadly there was indeed an attack but instead of striking a school as residents feared he struck the very newspaper that published the survey results Although fear can sometimes encourage taking reasonable precautions in the case of moral panics the steps are often useless of questionable value or even counterproductive Consider these examples Some schools despite limited budgets are purchasing active shooter insurance in case of liability For school teachers a few hours of training at a shooting range and simulated exercises hardly qualifies them to be prepared sufficiently for the real thing It is debatable whether active shooter drills in schools and workplaces really help but they certainly can arouse fear The message is We wouldnt be doing these drills were we not in real danger Inadvertently the drills can also inform a disgruntled student or employee of the best attack strategy In Michigan established an active shooter alert system patterned after the Amber Alert Unlike kidnappers active shooters rarely venture very far or remain active for long Widely broadcasting an alert could do more to frighten than protect citizens Overall the most significant downsides to our hypervigilance are the constant reminder of danger and the possibility of false alarms Plus the more we obsess over active shooters the more we entice angry individuals to seek redress with a gun James Alan Fox is the Lipman Professor of Criminology Law and Public Policy at Northeastern University a member of USA TODAYs Board of Contributors and coauthor of Extreme Killing Understanding Serial and Mass Murder Follow him on Twitter ,americas increasing moral panic over active shooters is overblown and counterproductive especially in light of the selfdefense movement thats been gaining steam at best for some time now The first thing to notice about selfdefense comes from its premise that If we do not take necessary action the aggressor will become the only enemy When you look at the above quotes its easy to see how this sort of selfdefense concept is,a police officer at the scene of a shooting in cleveland on july Scott Adams AP Photo Chris Gray Injured six others hurt Police officer in downtown

With a bullet in her gut her voice choked with pain Dee Hill pleaded with the dispatcher for help My husband accidentally shot me Hill of The Dalles Ore groaned on the May call In the stomach and he cant talk please Less than four feet away Hills husband Darrell Hill a former local police chief and twoterm county sheriff sat in his wheelchair with a discharged Glock handgun on the table in front of him unaware that hed nearly killed his wife of almost years The yearold lawman had been diagnosed two years earlier with a form of rapidly progressive dementia a disease that quickly stripped him of reasoning and memory He didnt understand said Dee who needed pints of blood three surgeries and seven weeks in the hospital to survive her injuries As America copes with an epidemic of gun violence that kills people each day there has been vigorous debate about how to prevent people with mental illness from acquiring weapons But a littleknown problem is what to do about the vast cache of firearms in the homes of aging Americans with impaired or declining mental faculties Darrell Hill a former local police chief and sheriff in Wasco County Oregon was diagnosed in with a form of rapidly progressive dementia Darrell Hill who died in was among the estimated percent of Americans and older diagnosed with dementia a group of terminal diseases marked by mental decline and personality changes Many like the Hills are gun owners and supporters of Second Amendment rights Fortyfive percent of people and older have guns in their household according to a Pew Research Center survey But no one tracks the potentially deadly intersection of those groups A fourmonth Kaiser Health News investigation has uncovered dozens of cases across the US in which people with dementia used guns to kill or injure themselves or others From news reports court records hospital data and public death records KHN found homicides and more than suicides since although there are likely many more The shooters often acted during bouts of confusion paranoia delusion or aggression common symptoms of dementia They killed people closest to them their caretaker wife son or daughter They shot at people they happened to encounter a mailman a police officer a t rain conductor At least four men with dementia who brandished guns were fatally shot by police In cases where charges were brought many assailants were deemed incompetent to stand trial Many killed themselves Among men in the US the suicide rate is highest among those and older firearms are the most common method according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention These statistics do not begin to tally incidents in which a person with dementia waves a gun at an unsuspecting neighbor or a terrified home health aide Volunteers with Alzheimers San Diego a nonprofit group became alarmed when they visited people with dementia to give caregivers a break and found to percent of those homes had guns said Jessica Empeo the groups vice president We made a decision as an organization not to send volunteers into the homes with weapons she said At the same time an analysis of government survey data in Washington state found that about percent of respondents and older reported both some cognitive decline and having firearms in their home The assessment conducted for KHN by a state epidemiologist suggests that about of the states more than million residents and older say they have worsening memory and confusion and access to weapons About percent of those respondents and older representing about people reported both cognitive decline and that they stored their guns unlocked and loaded according to data from the states Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey Washington is the only state to track those dual trends according to the CDC In a politically polarized nation where gun control is a divisive topic even raising concerns about the safety of cognitively impaired gun owners and their families is controversial Relatives can take away car keys far easier than removing a firearm the latter protected by the Second Amendment Only five states have laws allowing families to petition a court to temporarily seize weapons from people who exhibit dangerous behavior But in a country where people a day turn the potential for harm is growing said Dr Emmy Betz associate research director at the University of Colorado School of Medicine a leading researcher on gun access and violence Even as rates of dementia fall the sheer number of older people is soaring and the number of dementia cases is expected to soar as well By the number of people with dementia who live in US homes with guns could reach between roughly million and million according to a May study by Betz and her colleagues You cant just pretend its not going to come up Betz said Its going to be an issue Polling conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation for this story suggests that few Americans are concerned about the potential dangers of elders and firearms Nearly half of people queried in a nationally representative poll in June said they had relatives over who have guns Of those more than percent said they were not at all worried about a gunrelated accident Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation Dee Hill had ignored her husbands demands and sold Darrells car when it became too dangerous for him to drive But guns were another matter He was just almost obsessive about seeing his guns Dee said He worried that the weapons were dirty that they werent being maintained Though shed locked them in a vault in the carport she relented after Darrell had asked repeatedly to check on the guns hed carried every day of his nearly year law enforcement career She intended to briefly show him two of his six firearms the Glock handgun and a Smith Wesson Magnum revolver But after he saw the weapons Darrell accidentally knocked the empty pouch that had held the revolver to the floor When Dee bent to pick it up he somehow grabbed the Glock and fired My concern had been that someone was going to get hurt she said I didnt in my wildest dreams think it was going to be me An investigation classified the incident as an assault and referred it to Wasco County District Attorney Eric Nisley who concluded it was a conscious act to pick up the gun but that Darrell didnt intend to harm his wife I evaluated it as if a or yearold would pick up the gun and shoot someone Nisley said Dee was outraged at the suggestion she consider pressing charges I didnt want anyone to think it was intentional Nobody would have believed it anyway she said Dee Hill needed pints of blood three surgeries and seven weeks in the hospital Proponents of gun ownership say guns are not to blame The National Rifle Association declined to comment for this story Dr Arthur Przebinda who represents the group Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership said researchers raising the issue want to curtail gun rights guaranteed by the US Constitution and are seeking ways to disarm as many people as possible Focusing on the potential of people with dementia shooting others is a bloody shirtwaving tactic thats used to stir emotions to advance support for a particular policy endpoint he said Im not disputing the case that it happens I know it can happen Przebinda said My question is how prevalent it is because the data is what should be driving our policy discussion not fear or fearmongering Its bad science Two decades of NRAbacked political pressure that quashed public health research into the effects of gun violence partly explain the lack of data experts said But that doesnt mean theres no problem said Dr Garen Wintemute director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of CaliforniaDavis Critics are arguing as if what we have is evidence of absence he said We have something quite different which is absence of evidence Delmar and Vergie Verg Scroughams of Rexburg Idaho cant imagine living without guns Even some families grappling with the problem are wary about calls to limit gun access I hope your intent is not to bash us for our beliefs and actions with guns said Vergie Verg Scroughams of Rexburg Idaho who showed KHN reporters how she hid a loaded gun from her husband who developed dementia after a stroke in Verg became worried after Delmar Scroughams grew angry and erratic earlier this year waking up in the night and threatening to hit her It was out of character for the former contractor who previously built milliondollar Idaho vacation homes for families of politicians and celebrities In years of marriage weve never had a big fight she said We respect each other and we dont argue Thats not my Delmar I married my best friend Verg Scroughams said of her husband Delmar We have been inseparable for close to years Six months ago Verg took the loaded caliber Ruger from a drawer near Delmars living room recliner removed the bullets and tucked it under socks in a box on a high shelf in her closet Hell never look there she said She doesnt want Delmar to have access to that gun or to his collection of six shotguns locked in the bedroom cabinet But Verg a real estate agent who shows homes in remote locations doesnt want to give up the weapons she counts on for comfort and protection She carries her own handgun in the console of her car We live in Idaho Guns have been a big part of our lives said Verg who got her first rifle at age and recalls hunting trips with her two sons among her fondest memories I cant imagine living without guns Guns Under The Pillows Federal law prohibits people who are not mentally competent to make their own decisions including those with advanced dementia from buying or owning firearms But a mere diagnosis of dementia does not disqualify someone from owning a gun said Lindsay Nichols federal policy director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence If a gun owner were reluctant to give up his arsenal his family would typically have to take him to court to evaluate competency Since the school shooting in Parkland Fla in February more states are taking action to make it easier for families including those with a loved one with dementia to remove guns from the home Eleven states have passed red flag gun laws that allow law enforcement or other state officials and sometimes family members to seek a court order to temporarily seize guns from people who pose a threat to themselves or others Red flag bills have proliferated across the country since the Parkland shooting six were passed this year and six more are pending In Connecticut which in enacted the nations first red flag law police used the measure to seize guns from five people reported to have dementia in according to a KHN records review Last summer an yearold man with dementia alarmed his neighbors at a senior living community in Simsbury Conn by announcing that he had a gun and planned to shoot a bear The man later reported that his caliber Colt revolver was missing police found it loaded in the console of his car Police got a court order to seize that gun and a rifle he had in his closet What Families Can Do When a loved one gets dementia many families get no guidance on what to do about that persons guns Here are legal and practical steps to stay safe In December police seized guns from the Manchester Conn home of a yearold man with dementia who was threatening to kill his wife She told police that he was a danger to himself and that his threats were normal baseline behavior In police in Manchester also seized nine firearms from a yearold man with dementia who had pointed a gun at his daughter when she went to check on him because he didnt recognize her at first The man had been sleeping with loaded guns under his pillows and hiding guns in drawers and his daughter was worried for the safety of his home health aides In Ohio at one memory care clinic percent of patients diagnosed with dementia reported having a firearm in their homes according to a Cleveland Clinic study But many families are reluctant to take away the sense of safety independence and identity that their loved one often the family patriarch derives from guns A Guilt Ill Never Ever Get Away From In the Appalachian mountains of West Virginia Malissa Helmandollar a yearold assistant in an optometrists office regrets not taking her fathers guns away Her dad Larry Dillon loved to hunt Even after a coalmining accident left him paralyzed from the waist down at age Dillon would shoot turkey squirrel and deer from the seat of his fourwheeler For as long as she could remember her father kept a gun under the cushion of his wheelchair He felt he couldnt take care of us or himself without it she said In June when her father was she began to notice strange behavior He would see people crawling out of the washing machine she said He forgot how to tell time Sometimes he would just stare at his dinner plate like he didnt know what to do Every night for weeks Dillon grew scared that people were trying to break in and burn his house down Helmandollar said Dillon slept with a mm semiautomatic Glock pistol at his nightstand in the doublewide trailer he shared with his wife Sandy in Princeton WVa Helmandollar made him an appointment with a neurologist but he never made it to the doctor Five days before his appointment on July Helmandollars yearold daughter was sleeping over at her Mamaw and Papaws house as she loved to do That evening Helmandollar got a frantic call from her daughter Helmandollar sped to the house with her son She found her stepmother Sandy dead in an armchair with several bullet wounds Helmandollar heard her father tell police that he saw intruders breaking in to the house so he grabbed his Glock and started shooting in the bedroom where his wife and granddaughter were watching TV But there had been no intruders that night Dillon who was deemed incompetent to stand trial for murder was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia a disease whose early symptoms can include vivid visual hallucinations Helmandollar said her father never understood what he had done Before he died in April he kept asking Helmandollar why his wife never visited him She could never bring herself to tell him Meanwhile Helmandollars daughter and yearold son are in counseling for the trauma they experienced It crossed my mind that maybe I shouldve taken the guns and I didnt Helmandollar said Itll be a guilt that Ill never ever get away from Belated diagnoses of dementia are too common according to Dr Melissa Henston a geriatric psychologist in Denver who administers cognitive exams that can confirm impairment She said many of the patients she sees have moderate or even severe dementia before being diagnosed Theres denial and a false belief that a lot of cognitive problems are just normal for age she said These conversations that need to take place never take place until its too late For Alzheimers disease and other dementias there are limited treatments and no cure About onethird of people with the disease become combative during the course of their illness according to the Alzheimers Association And more than percent who develop dementia become violent toward their caretakers a study showed Advocates have long warned patients and families about the potential risk of guns said Beth Kallmyer the Alzheimers Association vice president of care and support The reality is theres no way to know whos at risk for becoming agitated or even violent she said We Need To Pay More Attention In Minnesota Sharon Van Leer the yearold director of diversity and inclusion at Mitchell Hamline School of Law said she never would have predicted the phone call she got from police nearly three years ago Her father Kenneth Bowser a yearold Army veteran and retired postal worker had been living for many years with his oldest son Larry in the St Paul suburb of Maplewood At pm on Sept Kenneth Bowser dialed Who is bothering you the dispatcher asked him according to a transcript of the call My oldest son oldest son and I shot him I shot him Bowser replied Hes laying there dead dead Where is the gun the dispatcher asked The gun is in my hand Bowser said Van Leer said she believes her father never intended to be violent Daddy was never like that In the call Bowser appears confused Im uh years old he said Im paralyzed on one side Bowser who had not been diagnosed with dementia before the shooting was confirmed to have Alzheimers and deemed not competent to stand trial Now Van Leer drives minutes most Sundays to visit her yearold father in a locked staterun nursing home where hes set to spend the rest of his life Staff wheel him out to a windowless visitation room where Van Leer and her sister spoonfeed him nutrition shakes and give him back rubs Van Leer said she had noticed some signs of decline before the shooting he would leave bacon on the stove and burn it or forget where he put his cigars But because she did not live with him she said she didnt realize how far his dementia had progressed We need to pay more attention as our parents get older to the changes Van Leer said They can disguise it really well Removing guns from the home is the best way to prevent violence the Alzheimers Association and other experts advise But Dr Diana Kerwin director of the Texas Alzheimers and Memory Disorders program at Texas Health said thats not the answer for all families I dont do a blanket guns are bad you cant have guns in the home she said Instead she advocates storing guns safely locked up unloaded with the ammunition kept separate from the guns Firearms can also be disabled or in some cases replaced with a decoy although that raises the risk of them being mistaken for a real weapon in an emergency We had one patient with a gun with rubber bands that he would shoot and he was fine with that Kerwin said He was used to shooting varmints You try to help them maintain the lifestyle they always had HairTrigger Tempers Families walk a fine line balancing independence with safety Christal Collins a yearold massage therapist in South Carolina never got along with her dad He beat her and her mother before the couple divorced she said But when he nearly died from spinal meningitis in Christal agreed to take him in along with his small arsenal Bill Collins a retired heavyequipment operator and Army veteran was so attached to his guns that he kept a caliber pistol in his pocket day and night even while he slept On Saturdays hed load it with rat shot and fire the tiny pellets at snakes as he mowed the lawn On Sunday mornings as he watched Shepherds Chapel sermons on TV hed clean the gun and reload it with Magnum bullets Bill also kept a cabinet stocked with three handguns three sawedoff rifles three hunting rifles and a thousand rounds of ammo While he had stopped hunting he told his family he didnt want to be caught without a gun when the race war broke out A family photo shows Christal Collins left with her father Bill and sisters Tracy and Marie As he grew older and sicker Bill shuffled around the house in slippers and didnt seem as physically threatening Christal said But his bouts of aggression and paranoia grew worse and in November after Bill had gotten lost for two hours at a local convenience store his doctor said he was showing signs of dementia Christal considered sending her father to an assisted living complex but when he found out he couldnt bring his guns or knives he refused to go And she swore she would never put her parents through the neglect she saw when she worked at a nursing home So she stayed in the house with him in a rural swampy stretch of Conway SC not far from Myrtle Beach Christal tried to limit her fathers access to guns One day she slipped the key to his gun cabinet off his keychain a difficult feat since he slept with the keychain hooked to his belt It was war in the house for three days she said as he hounded her and accused her of stealing the key He then busted the original lock with a hammer and screwdriver and installed three new padlocks Christal Collins says her father who struggled with paranoia shot her fiance Allen Holtzman in Bill also slept with a loaded Magnum under his pillow There was no gun safety Christal said Every time I tried to talk about it it would be a fight or an argument or a problem On June a Sunday her father started cussing and ranting and raving accusing someone of stealing things from his room she said Bill who was raised his hand to hit Christal something he hadnt done in his old age and her fianc Allen Holtzman stepped in to intervene In a flash Bill pulled the pistol out of his pocket and fired at Holtzmans chest knocking him down to the couch Dad you shot him Christal yelled in disbelief Then she saw him put the gun at the base of Holtzmans skull She knocked it away just as he fired Wrong damn shells Bill declared in disappointment discovering he had fired rat shot Bill aimed the gun at Holtzmans yearold daughter and then at Christal He had a look in his eyes like the lights were on but nobody was home Christal recalled She dragged Holtzman who was bleeding from over rat pellets toward safety in their bedroom as more pellets flew behind them Christal Collins says that if she had to do it again she would have removed her fathers guns from the home As Christal talked to a dispatcher on the phone she heard two bangs The first was her father slamming the door to his room The second was her father taking the gun and after replacing the cartridges shooting himself in the head Some argue that people should have the right to end their lives on their own terms instead of suffer through the debilitating decline of dementia But Christal said she hates that her father harmed others along the way And the aftermath of a suicide can be horrific she said When you clean your dads brain matter off the wall the pillow the carpet she said trailing off in tears the trauma still raw nearly three years later as she sat with her fianc in their doublewide trailer home Holtzman a yearold construction worker shrugged off his own injuries saying the pellets just burned But Christal said they were lucky her father forgot to change the ammo Allen you wouldve been dead Christal said Christal said if she had to do it again she would have removed the guns from the home Though she reflected I honestly dont know if we could have taken them away Giving Up The Guns For families grappling with such decisions one option is to establish a gun trust that outlines how the weapons will pass to family members once a person becomes incapacitated or dies These trusts may make it easier for people who must give up firearms in order to move into a nursing home for instance said David Goldman an estateplanning lawyer in Jacksonville Fla who said he has drawn up over gun trusts But the process works best when the gun owner complies They rarely want to give up their guns Goldman said Another obstacle is that gun trusts must be drawn up before dementia becomes too advanced Ideally families should discuss firearm access soon after a diagnosis of dementia and consider setting a firearm retirement date akin to an advance directive for guns Betz and colleagues advise Its similar to discussions about taking away the car keys when driving becomes dangerous she said One of the tricky things is for driving there are some assessments you can do Betz said Theyre not perfect but theyre helpful There isnt anything for firearms Doctors who routinely ask dementia patients about driving should also ask about guns Wintemute said Too often though they dont Docs say I dont know enough about the risks and benefits I dont have the time Wintemute said Only about onethird do it with any frequency Critics of gun restrictions like Przebinda argue that the essential difference between driving and guns is that one is a privilege and the other is a protected constitutional right The two are not the same he said You do not have a right to conveyance You have a right to selfdefense you have a right to protecting your home and your family thats intrinsic to you as a human being He balks at any formal assessment of firearm use among people with dementia saying it could lead to a totalitarian system that decides when you can have rights and when you cannot Instead the decision should be left to families Przebinda said People who own guns know what measures are available to them Even that knowledge however may not be enough Dee Hill of Oregon said it was strictly an accident that her husband the retired sheriff shot and critically wounded her To this day she doesnt regret showing him the guns Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter That sounds stupid but no I dont she

her to make sure no one is harmed I would feel extremely responsible she said It would be my fault,dementia complicates us gun ownership It reduces the availability and enjoyment of safe effective firearms The National Firearms Act a federal law that has not been enforced in more than a hundred years allows the sale of gun parts only if the purchaser complies with all of the following rules A The purchaser does not have an inventory condition that is more than ten years removed from the date when the purchaser first buys including the date when the purchaser sells the firearm and B The,a gun used by a man with dementia You can say that some people are just doing a gun buy and they feel guilty That they should be held accountable to make sure that we dont end up without some kind of

FILE PHOTO Rifles are seen at the Sturm Ruger Co Inc gun factory in Newport New Hampshire January REUTERSEric ThayerFile Photo By Ross Kerber BOSTON Reuters Funds run by BlackRock Inc BLKN and Vanguard Group backed all directors at gunmaker Sturm Ruger Co Inc RGRN despite the companys rare rejection of talks with the worlds top asset managers disclosures to regulators on Thursday showed The votes by the gunmakers largest investors stood in contrast to support BlackRock and Vanguard gave to a measure calling on Sturm Ruger to report on the safety of its products which passed over the boards objections at the companys annual meeting on May Neither BlackRock nor Vanguard would discuss in detail their votes at the meeting It drew attention amid a nationwide youthled gun control movement following a mass shooting at a Florida high school in February that killed people one in a decadeslong series of shootings at US schools colleges and workplaces Sturm Ruger declined to comment on the filings by the funds with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday BlackRock holds about percent of shares outstanding followed by Vanguard with about percent Both fund firms rarely vote against directors and say critical votes may come only after companies fail to respond to shareholder concerns Since July BlackRock and Vanguard said in separate investment stewardship reports that they had held talks with other US public companies that make or sell civilian firearms Investors and activists with a range of views about gun control said the asset managers split tickets seemed to reflect an approach designed to appeal to young investors concerned with social issues without alienating clients who own guns or pushing Sturm Rugers board too quickly The big fund firms have to look at sensitivities of their clients and business partners said Brian Rafn principal of Morgan Dempsey Capital Management in Milwaukee who described himself as a gunrights supporter and says the firm voted all its or so shares with Sturm Rugers management Eli KasargodStaub cofounder of Majority Action a group that had campaigned for top funds to vote against Sturm Ruger director Sandra Froman a past president of the National Rifle Association called the votes a failure of leadership by the fund managers The only plausible explanation to me is that they were simply trying to avoid controversy he said BlackRock spokeswoman Tara McDonnell said via email it takes a casebycase approach to its engagement and voting because doing so encourages change over time and promotes responsible business practices that align with the financial interests of our clients In a statement emailed by spokeswoman Carolyn Wegemann Vanguard said that while a companys willingness to engage can affect its voting decisions corporate moves to improve shareholder value may unfold over the course of a few years rather than a few months Sturm Ruger is unusual in that its executives and directors will not talk with investors directly at a time both big passive managers have stressed more engagement with companies in their portfolios Sturm Ruger Chief Executive Officer Christopher Killoy at the May meeting said it does not meet with top holders including BlackRock and Vanguard because of fairdisclosure rules a rare stance BlackRock voted against Exxon directors over similar discussion limits in the past and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink earlier this year told CEOs that engagement needs to be a yearround conversation about improving longterm value BlackRock and Vanguard said they would contact gunmakers after the Florida shooting Sturm Ruger said previously its directors each won more than million votes at the May meeting The most votes withheld from any director was Thursdays filings showed funds including BlackRocks iShares Core SP SmallCap ETF IJRP and Vanguard SmallCap Index Fund VBP voted for all nine directors and for the safety report In a July investment stewardship report BlackRock said it had talks with nearly all US public gun manufacturers or sellers The company also said that at one unidentified gunmaker that did not allow shareholder talks it voted for a safety report Vanguards similar report in midAugust said that during the months ended June it spoke with three gunmakers and supported a shareholder resolution calling for more risk disclosure at a company it did not identify Vanguard wrote that in its outreach our objective is not to change what business a company is in or what product it produces but rather to ensure that the risks of these choices are understood by the market and reflected in the companys longterm value to investors Reporting by Ross Kerber editing by Grant McCool,limited engagement top funds backed

A littleknown dispute over Dprinted guns has morphed into a national legal debate in the last week drawing attention to a technology that seems a bit of scifi fantasy and to guncontrol advocates a dangerous way for criminals to get their hands on firearms that are easy to conceal and tough to detect The gun industry calls the outcry an overreaction that preys on unwarranted fears about a firearm that can barely shoot a round or two without disintegrating It also raises a host of constitutional questions involving First Amendment protections for free speech and Second Amendment rights to own guns Here are some questions and answers about the debate Q What is behind the dispute A Cody Wilson the founder of Texasbased Defense Distributed first posted downloadable blueprints for a handgun called the Liberator that could be made using a D printer in Within days it had been downloaded about times until the State Department ordered him to cease contending it violated federal export laws since some of the blueprints were saved by people outside the United States The dispute between Wilson and the federal government went on for years until this past June when they reached a settlement that paved the way for Wilson to resume posting the designs The State Department decision came amid an obscure administrative change begun under the Obama administration in how the weapons are regulated and administered Military grade weapons remain under the purview of the State Department while commercially available firearms fall under the Commerce Department The settlement with Wilson determined that Dprinted firearms are akin to more traditional firearms that arent subject to State Department regulations Wilson resumed sharing his blueprints for the gun the day the settlement went into effect last week Q Why does Wilson want the authority to post the designs on his website A Wilson calls it a First Amendment issue He believes the First Amendment gives him a constitutional right to disseminate the code to make a gun with a D printer Story continues This is a very very very easy First Amendment question that I think people might be hesitant to accept because it involves guns and people dont like guns said his lawyer Josh Blackman And Wilson has a strong legal claim that distribution of the information is different than actually making an allplastic firearm While it is a violation of the federal Undetectable Firearms Act to make sell or possess a firearm that cant be detected by magnetometers or metal detectors what Wilson is doing is simply providing the information on how to make such a firearm What Defense Distributed was doing was not making and then shipping the weapons overseas said Chuck James a former federal prosecutor who is now a private lawyer with the Washington DCarea firm of Williams Mullen They were making the data available on the Web where it would be available to someone overseas Q What kind of gun designs are available on the website A Defense Distributed shows a variety of designs The code for a D printed gun is for what he calls the Liberator which gets its name from a pistol American forces used during World War II His design includes a metal firing pin and a metal block His site also includes blueprints to make various ARplatform long guns and some other handguns using more traditional means and materials Q Are D printed guns legal A In the US enacted the Undetectable Firearms Act making it illegal to manufacture sell or possess a firearm that couldnt be detected by a metal detector That law has been renewed several times by Congress and remains in effect If D printed guns contain enough metal to be flagged by a metal detector they are considered legal under US law Guncontrol advocates argue that the risks are too great to allow D printed guns because even if theyre designed to include metal its too easy for someone to not include those pieces or to remove them to skirt detection Its an absurdity You can take the piece of metal out and put it back in at your own whims and you can take it out and walk through a metal detector undetected said Jonas Oransky legal director for Everytown for Gun Safety Q How well do D printed guns work A Gun experts and enthusiasts recoil at the suggestion that a D printed gun is a true threat calling the firearms mere novelties Unlike traditional firearms that can fire thousands of rounds in their lifetime Dprinted guns are notorious for usually lasting only a few rounds before they fall apart They dont have magazines that allow the usual nine or rounds to be carried instead they usually hold a bullet or two and then must be manually loaded afterward And theyre not usually very accurate either A video posted of a test by the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives in showed one of the guns produced from Wilsons design the Liberator disintegrating into pieces after a single round was fired People have got this Star Trek view of the guns being futuristic marvels said Chris Knox communications director for The Firearms Coalition a gunrights group Were not talking about exotic technology Others are quick to point out that normal guns are readily available in the US with little regulation making Dprinted guns a major hassle compared with regular weapons Q Whats the status of the debate A A federal judge on Tuesday issued a temporary restraining order blocking Wilson from continuing to post the designs on his site A hearing is to be held in that case next week In the meantime President Donald Trump criticized the Department of Justice advising the State Department to reach a settlement with Wilson without first consulting with him Wilsons website currently displays a banner asking people to help to uncensor the site Clicking a link directs the person to a page to pay membership dues ranging from a month to for a lifetime,dispute over dprinted guns raises many legal issues In April I joined the Legal Defense Fund LDF with other civil libertarians and began a legal advocacy campaign against firearms In June we created a legal advocacy group entitled LDR Legal Libertarian Law Center

US Rep Eric Swalwell on Friday said the US government would use its nuclear weapons in a hypothetical war against Second Amendment supporters refusing to give up their firearms The California Democrat who is openly considering a run for the Democratic Partys presidential nomination in made the outlandish remark on social media after a gunrights advocate pointed out that the lawmaker once called for gun owners to surrender their assault weapons So basically wants a war Because thats what you would get Youre outta your f mind if you think Ill give up my rights and give the government all the power Joe Biggs tweeted at Swalwell This prompted Swalwell to defend himself saying it would be a short war because the government has nukes implying the government would use its nuclear arsenal against its own citizens The comment drew an immediate backlash with thousands of people criticizing the lawmaker for the illthoughtout remark Here is an actual member of the US Congress talking about using nuclear weapons against Americans David Freddoso wrote Personally I have a bigger problem with an elected official blithely talking about nuking his fellow Americans than my neighbor owning an AR Cam Edwards tweeted Swalwell a member of both the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee tried to defuse the situation saying the need for a firearm to protect against the government is ludicrous and suggested that if an assault weapon ban would happen people would just follow the law He later clarified that he was merely being facetious in his suggestion about the use of nuclear weapons I sarcastically pointed out USA isnt losing to his assault weapon its not the th Century he wrote Meanwhile Swalwell appeared Friday on HBOs Real Time with Bill Maher show talking about his potential plan to run for president saying hes considering it The lawmaker who will turn in November would be the youngest candidate ever elected president He also came out unapologetically for his fellow California Democrat Nancy Pelosi backing her for the House speaker position and promising to use the Democratic House majority to investigate President Trump and pressure the president to release his tax returns,california dem says us would win short war against gunrights advocates the government has nukes fox news foxnewscom May The Department of Homeland Security is recommending no one on Capitol Hill should be allowed to carry openly in a national airport if federal law bans the carrying of handguns inside the restricted areas ADVERTISEMENT DHS officials on Tuesday told FoxNewscom that if all a security guard needs to know he,representative eric swalwell of california They have also managed to acquire new patents The case which relates directly to mobile phone patents and how the law works also includes cases involving other mobile devices The defendants in all three cases are Comcastcom which owns the Android TV and the YouTube streaming platform that are all under the common control of Time Warner Corporation Rozak Corp Rozak was,1

The gun control measures in the bill though relatively small compared to the assault weapons ban unsuccessfully sought by Democrats mark an unprecedented shift in the Florida Capitol AP Photo Florida House passes gun reform school safety bill after lengthy debate TALLAHASSEE The Republicanled Florida House passed a school safety package that includes an unprecedented tightening of gun control regulations on Wednesday The close vote placed reluctant GOP legislators in a vice between browbeating chamber leadership and the powerful National Rifle Association The vote was also tough for House Democrats who earlier in the day decided to take a caucus position against the bill because it would allow for armed educational personnel in schools Of House Republicans voted in favor of the bill with against it Of the House Democrats voted yes and voted no The provision played a major role in the legislations near defeat Monday night when the Florida Senate barely passed the bill Advertisement Called The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act the bill now goes to Gov Rick Scott for his signature Legislators say Scott who expressed reservations about armed teachers before the provision was watered down is expected to sign it into law The gun control measures in the bill though relatively small compared to the assault weapons ban unsuccessfully sought by Democrats mark an unprecedented shift in the Florida Capitol which has been a bastion of gunrights legislation for decades Those who supported the legislation including the House Democrats said the million bill was a needed first step in preventing another mass shooting like the one that unfolded at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Fla on Feb when a gunman slaughtered people including students The page bill FL SB R would allow for the hiring of more school resources officers physical security improvements to schools new age and waitingperiod limits on shotgun and rifle purchases and more police powers to seize weapons from dangerous people Those opposed it were aligned with gun reform groups who chastised Republican lawmakers for refusing to ban tactical weapons like the AR used at the Parkland school As the bill was being debated for hours in the House Scott wouldnt say if he would sign it When a bill makes it to my desk Ill do what they dont seem to be doing in Washington Im going to review the bill line by line said Scott whos strongly considering a bid for US Senate Im going to be talking to the groups I care the most about right now because it impacted them so much the families Asked if the House should pass the bill so it could get to his desk so he could read it Scott demurred They should do what theyre doing They should debate the bill he said Scott reiterated his opposition to arming teachers but its not clear if he supports the softened provision that essentially prohibits frontline fulltime teachers from packing All other types of school personnel though could carry firearms if they qualify House Democrats took a caucus position to vote against the bill before Wednesdays floor session began but they too were divided The vote But Democrats and Republicans alike agreed that the Stoneman Douglas tragedy was a call to bridge political and ideological differences What this bill represents to me is a bill that may not pull us to the center but pulls us together state Rep Kristin Jacobs a Democrat whose district includes Stoneman Douglas High School told her colleagues Members the only way we win is if we vote yes on this bill State Rep Chris Latvala RClearwater agreed with Jacobs that partisan politics had no bearing on the bill There are votes worth not being here next year and this is one of them he said State Rep George Moraitis RFort Lauderdale said bipartisan support would show the world Floridas government can set aside politics If we cant come together and attack this how are we going to attack the problems in our communities Moraitis said Dont let emotion and anger get in the way of good legislation But Moraitis Fort Lauderdale neighbor Democratic state Rep Patricia Williams bristled at his remarks This happens day in and day out for children in my district Williams said of gun violence in her minorityheavy Fort Lauderdale district She said she wanted an assault weapons ban and wasnt opposed to gun rights I dont have a problem with you carrying guns I carry mine she said on the House floor Before a final vote state Rep Jared Moskowitz DCoral Springs a graduate of the school who summoned House Republican leaders to the scene to view the bloody aftermath pleaded with his colleagues to approve it You dont need to stand with me Moskowitz said fighting back tears Push the green button Tensions have been running high over the issue in Tallahassee A libertarian activist delivered jars of tar and feathers to some senators after the chamber voted for the legislation earlier this week In the House racial divisions emerged between Democrats when some AfricanAmericans fumed that white lawmakers were going the extra mile to react to the Parkland shooting when so many Black Caucus members represent communities ripped apart by gunfire on a more frequent basis For black lawmakers the armed personnel language led to prolonged debate about racial disparities in crime and education the states controversial Stand Your Ground lethal force bill and the shooting death of yearold Trayvon Martin in The Black Caucus vehemently opposed to more guns in schools had voted to oppose the bill though some members disagreed One of them was state Rep Kimberly Daniels DJacksonville who said she felt comfortable any arming of school employees must be approved by local school boards Im up on this bill because blood is crying from the ground in South Florida Daniels said Im not saying this to be against anyone politically but Im going to stand for what I believe and this is about accountability State Rep Rene Plasencia ROrlando lamented that teachers were not hired to protect and serve like law enforcement As a teacher and a track coach he recalled a time a mother promised to hold him responsible if her son was hurt under his watch From that moment on I realized that was my job Plasencia said My greatest fear was if one of my kids died on my watch Citing failures at the local state and national levels to identify or stop the Parkland shooter state Rep Bob Rommel RNaples said the armed school personnel provision was one of the best parts of the bill because when everything else fails when everything else fails theyre there to step in and maybe save lives He also spoke about a lack of religiousness and an increase in unwed mothers in the US but he stopped short of blaming those phenomena directly on gun violence Republicans faced an onslaught of pressure from groups like the NRA which sent emails urging constituents to call representatives who were being strongarmed by House leaders State Rep Tom Leek ROrlando said he received calls from constituents who told him to move if he supports the bill I care very little about what other people think Leek said The fact that someone would give their vote away to a caucus position this is too important Family members of the Stoneman Douglas victims sent a letter on Tuesday to lawmakers imploring them to support the bill The fathers of two of the teenage girls killed in the attack spent hours meeting with reluctant House Republicans to explain its provisions The fathers found that many lawmakers had not fully read the bill As the House debated the bill two Parkland fathers met briefly with the press outside the chamber to urge lawmakers to pass the legislation If anyones voting against they have a different agenda than what their community has which is protecting our kids and making them safe said Andrew Pollack whose yearold daughter Meadow was killed Whoevers voting no doesnt have the interests of the kids in the community as their best interest Asked what type of agenda he meant Pollack said he didnt know because he could not comprehend a no vote Ryan Petty father of yearold Alaina said nothing in life is ever perfect but that the benefits of the bill outweighed the bad parts Polling suggests the legislation will be far more popular than the vote in the Legislature By wide margins Florida voters support banning bumpfire stocks and adding waiting periods and age limits to long gun purchases polls show Voters however dont favor arming teachers The polls show however that Republican voters are generally leastinclined to support gun control and do back arming teachers a provision tacked in the legislation to placate the NRA and GOP primary voters The debate lasted for so many hours more than eight that Petty had to catch a flight and Pollack opted to miss his plane back home In a sign of just how important guns are in a GOP primary Florida Attorney General candidate and state Rep Jay Fant RJacksonville has made firearms central to his candidacy On the House floor he said Wednesday that the bill was unconstitutional because of the ban on people under from buying a long gun I just cant imagine Nikolas Cruz can commit such a heinous crime he said and then as a result we tell potentially a yearold single mother living alone that she cannot purchase a firearm to defend herself in the state of Florida This is not constitutional on its face The bill offers stricter gun control measures by raising the age limit for purchases from to and requires a threeday waiting period for the purchase of all weapons Theres also a ban on bump stocks which make the rapid shooting easier The bill also includes money for school districts to hire more school resource officers and programs that beef up mental health services There is a provision that expands the powers of law enforcement by allowing them to temporarily suspend someones gun rights if they are admitted for psychiatric evaluation under the state Baker Act They could also petition a court to extend the suspension of powers over the hour life of the Baker Act to days Perhaps the most controversial provision is the Aaron Feis Guardian Program which would deploy highlytrained school employees under the direction of the sheriff in each county It was named after a Stoneman Douglas assistant football coach killed in the attack Following the House vote state Rep Jose Oliva RMiami Lakes who sponsored the bill praised its passage Never again means never again he said in a statement But while words matter getting this bill to Governor Scott then getting to work is the most important part of this mission We cant bring the precious lives lost too soon back but we can honor their memory by making the dreams and goals of this bill a reality he added Said House Speaker Richard Corcoran in a statement after the House votel Today the House kept its word to the students and families of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School When we said never again we meant it We have passed game changing legislation that will ensure our students safety as long as our local electeds take up our charge For those like me who love the blessings of our Constitution we have passed the greatest advancement of nd amendment protections in our states history he added While most of the attention on the bill has focused on armed teachers and the waiting periods and age limitations for long gun purchases lawmakers and advocates on both sides of the debate have said little about the expansion of police powers to seize weapons from people deemed a threat by either police or a court In cases where police involuntarily commit someone deemed a threat to himself or others officers may seize and hold a firearm or any ammunition if the person in question has made a credible threat of violence The guns and ammo can be returned within hours of the person being discharged from a holding facility Police can however hold on to the weapons and ammunition for seven days in some cases The bill also generally bans firearm possession by those judged mentally defective or who have been committed to a mental institution Additionally the legislation creates the Risk Protection Order Act that allows police to petition a court to allow law enforcement to temporarily seize ammunition and guns for up to a year from a person who poses a significant danger of causing personal injury to himself or herself or others Under this risk protection order section of the bill a judge can grant the order based on a variety of criteria including whether the gun owner has committed or threatened an act of violence in the prior year is a stalker or has been convicted had adjudication withheld or pleaded no contest to a domestic violence charge In emergency situations police can seize the weapons without a full hearing which would be conducted after the fact As the legislation was being

WASHINGTON The businessman who once supported tighter gun control and then opposed it after he became a presidential candidate is now under pressure to switch back in favor of certain new firearms laws In the wake of last weeks mass shooting at a South Florida high school Trump has White House meetings scheduled this week with groups of students and local officials about the prospects of tougher gun laws to protect schools The president on Monday expressed some support for some changes to the gun background check system by opening the door to a bipartisan congressional proposal designed to improve the sharing of mental health and criminal record information between state and local agencies and the federal background check database While discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered the president is supportive of efforts to improve the federal background check system said White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders Trump himself did not comment on the gun issue Monday His weekend at his MaraLago estate in Palm Beach Fla was dominated by a renewed gun debate after a student was charged with killing people and injuring more than a dozen others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Fla Sanders confirmed that Trump spoke on Friday with Sen John Cornyn RTex about a background check bill he has has introduced with Sen Chris Murphy DConn Murphy said Trumps apparent support is another sign the politics of gun violence are shifting rapidly In a tweet the Connecticut senator said that no one should pretend this bill alone is an adequate response to this epidemic Yet is unclear how far Trump is willing to go on gun control or if hell take any action at all During his weekend at MaraLago Trump visited a local hospital to speak with people injured in the shooting and their families Some of the students who survived the shooting blanketed cable television news programs some watched by Trump to press their case for more gun legislation During a Saturday rally student and shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez went after the National Rifle Association by saying that politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this we call BS They say tougher guns laws do not decrease gun violence We call BS Previous mass shootings during Trumps term from the Las Vegas Strip to a church in South Texas both within the past five months have not led to legislative action in part because Republicans who run Congress say they would be ineffective and in some cases would infringe on Second Amendment gun rights In a book published well before he ran for president Trump said he has generally opposed gun control but at that time did back a ban on assault weapons and a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun During his campaign Trump became a champion of the Second Amendment and welcomed contributions from the National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups During the NRA convention last year Trump bashed predecessor Barack Obama and said the eightyear assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end You have a true friend and champion in the White House Geraldo Rivera of Fox News who spoke with Trump over the weekend said he suggested the president back a law to deny the sale of certain weapons to anyone under the age of On Twitter Rivera also suggested a safe schools act to provide federal money for security guards and consultants on hardening educational institutions to protect our most valuable assets our school kids Trumps critics are skeptical about whether he will really push for anything Rick Wilson a Florida Republican political consultant who has been critical of Trump said he suspects Trump is reacting to the fact that he had a lot of folks at MaraLago reacting to the killings of students Id be surprised if there was actual action he said but the NRA and its allies should realize that Trump has no fixed ideology and reacts to emotion and other impulses Sen Edward J Markey DMass said Trump has already failed if he thinks supporting expanded background checks is enough to address the problem The families and students of Parkland arent looking for a modest step Markey said they are looking for real action to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldnt have them MoreExclusive Feds issue orders to seize guns from people who failed background checks MoreTexas church shooting Background check breakdown highlights federal gun record problems The Cornynbacked bill introduced after a November shooting at a church in Texas would provide financial incentives to states and federal agencies to work harder to comply with laws requiring them to report criminal and mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System NICS Gun sellers are required in most circumstances to run the names of wouldbe gun buyers through the system to ensure they are not barred from purchasing firearms The shooter at the Texas church had been allowed to buy guns despite having a criminal record because the Air Force failed to share his records with the FBI Trump who has cited claims about the suspects mental health problems and criticized the FBI for failing to follow up on a tip about the shooter has been reluctant to back gun control after past school shootings So have Republican members of Congress many of whom are recipients of contributions from the National Rifle Association and other gun groups who say the focus should be on mental health and tighter school security measures MoreSome Republicans join call for stronger background checks on gun buyers Trumps schedule this week includes at least two events devoted to school violence On Wednesday he is scheduled to host a listening session with high school students and teachers The next day Trump meets with state and local officials on school safety according to the White House schedule Trump has been criticized for a Sunday tweet that seemed to blame the school shooting on the FBIs investigation into Russias election meddling MoreTrump slams FBI over missed signals on Florida shooting says too much time spent on Russia Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter Trump said This is not acceptable They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign there is no collusion Get back to the basics and make us all proud,florida shooting puts gun control pressure on trumps campaign Trumps latest criticism has been that Clinton is under attack by some of her backers by questioning whether she agrees with her views on gun control But on Tuesday the Washington Post reported that the presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump had criticized Sen Bernie Sanders IVt the Vermont independent over the Democratic presidential nominees stance on gun control Trump slammed Clinton as a very

the key to renewing the community he suggested Where your body is failing you your wisdom knowledge and understanding put in younger bodies will solve some of these problems But in our community its

herself and renters some of whom live in public housing As a result a wall exists between the groups that has yet to be bridged she said The city created the problem because you dont tear down the

The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence the group behind federal background checks for firearms purchasers is launching a new ad campaign that is an effort to find common ground in a country divided on the issue of gun control The campaign launching Wednesday finds its way to television via public service announcements facilitated by the Ad Council and aims to make the term family fire a household word as it describes accidental shootings of children and other family members in homes across the nation Rather than mudslinging and name calling were focusing on how can we act to keep our kids alive said Kyleanne Hunter a Brady Center vice president And that might open the door to more discussion about how to end gun violence This footinthedoor strategy is composed of at least a years worth of End Family Fire TV digital and online ads that center on a conversation between an elementaryschool aged boy and his father The boy asks if a firearm is in the house but he soon reveals that he knows where its kept and that he could use it to confront a bully But it is our gun the boy says In our home Happens all the time The fulllength spot concludes with the words kids a day are accidentally killed or injured by FAMILY FIRE FAMILY FIRE is a shooting involving an improperly stored gun Let our news meet your inbox The news and stories that matters delivered weekday mornings This site is protected by recaptcha The Brady Center citing US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data states that million children live in homes with unlocked and loaded guns three in four know where the guns are stored So far gunowners rights groups dont appear to be open to the Family Fire campaign The National Rifle Association didnt immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News But Jordan Stein director of communications for the organization Gun Owners of America said via email that locking up firearms is not a panacea for keeping children away from danger Every death is tragic but statistically speaking more young children die choking on hotdogs than are killed accidentally by firearms he said supporting his argument with recent data from the CDC So forcing every home to have their guns locked up will only make gun owners less safe After all when a criminal breaks into a persons home hes not going to wait for the gun owner to unlock his firearm The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence the Ad Council and Droga introduce new phrase and national PSAs to reduce the number of deaths and injuries resulting from unsecured or misused guns in the home The Brady Campaign The timing of the ad blitz there still has been no federal legislative action following the school shooting in Parkland Florida Feb and following the Las Vegas massacre Oct could also be seen by antigun activists as odd Advocates for stricter rules for firearms owners are also grappling with hitech weapons such as D printed guns and ghost guns made of untracable parts that exist under the radar of law enforcement in most states But Brady Center officials say the need to find compromise with the gun owners rights contingent is urgent without it a fix for easy access to firearms on the part of criminals and mass shooters might never be addressed In the gun violence conversation gun owners were largely missing Hunter said Added Kris Brown copresident of the organization People are frustrated by the stalemate we have on both sides Keeping children away from guns should be a nobrainer they argue that everyone can get behind even as comedian Sacha Baron Cohen trolled some Republicans to admit they embrace the idea that kids should be trained to use firearms This is completely outside the realm of politics Brown said Its not red state blue state its families who want to do whats best to protect the most vulnerable In fact the Family Fire campaign officially recommends simply that gun owners with firearms stored in homes where children live keep them secure and separate from ammunition A simple gun lock can make a major difference the campaign states on its website Hunter said the campaign which is supported by the groups Droga National Parent Teacher Association Doctors for America the DC Police Foundation and others is in some ways akin to the harm reduction movement for drug users If nothing can stop it society might as well make it as safe as possible But Hunter said the Brady Center likens it more to the campaign to stop drunken driving We have to find a way to foster a more rich and common understanding about guns in this country that dont cause people to go to the other side of the divide Brown said CLARIFICATION Aug pm An earlier version of this article stated that the Brady Centers campaign is in some ways akin to the harm reduction movement for drug users The Brady Center did not dispute that comparison but said it preferred to liken its campaign to one intended to end drunken driving The article has been

White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller has faced widespread backlash over his hardline views on immigration but on Monday a member of his own family emerged as one of his strongest critics In a scathing editorial published by Politico Millers uncle David Glosser said he was horrified by his immigration hypocrite nephew asserting that if his nephews ideas on immigration had been in force a century ago his own family would have been wiped out Despite Millers ancestors coming to the US in search of safety after fleeing violent antiJewish pogroms in what is now known as Belarus the senior adviser has led a seemingly merciless campaign to push for policies restricting immigration to the country But that is not the only way the politicians hardline views belie his familys roots with the conservative senior adviser born into a liberal family of Democrats in Santa Monica California According to Politico Miller veered from the path of his Democrat parents at an early age after a copy of National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierres book Guns Crime and Freedom fell into his hands Guns Crime and Freedom The page book is mainly focused on dismantling arguments in support of gun control including those in favor of assault weapon bans However it also attacks a broad range of other progressive ideas including welfare and criminal justice reform Guns Crime and Freedom has all the facts the books jacket states It explores the issues of gun control crime and the Second Amendment and provides documented evidence and telling statements about the agenda of those who want to ban guns Later in the book LaPierre wrote This is about freedom Not crime not hunting not recreation Freedom And people dont want to lose it adding that people were totally fed up with misreporting on the gun control debate in the national media A article on the tome written by David Steitfeld for The Washington Post suggests that once you know the book was written by Wayne LaPierre the head of the National Rifle Association you can easily guess its message However Steitfeld noted that what one couldnt have guessed was how popular the message would become with Guns Crime and Freedom becoming DCbased Regnery Publishings biggest success in the publishers year history with HarperCollins buying paperback rights for a sixfigure sum Among those propelling the book to a coveted spot on The New York Times bestseller list was a young Stephen Miller The ideas espoused in the tome reportedly provided the framework for a belief system on immigration that appeared to be in the early stages of formation in a column Miller wrote for a Christian publication shortly after graduating from Santa Monica High School In the March column titled My Dream for the End of Racism a teenage Miller called for universal equality for all men all women all races and all creeds Miller wrote of how overjoyed he felt to be living in a country where anyone who wishes to succeed may do so given sufficient drive devotion and commitment However the thenyearold appeared to later suggest in the piece that the best prescription for the disease of racism was to bring people in the US together in an apparent push for cultural homogeneity We should stress the one culture that we all hold in commonthe American culture Miller wrote There is so much to share and to be proud of in our nations glorious history he continued There must be more American celebrations more patriotic exercises more focus on America and why our ancestors came here more study of this nations valiant efforts at fighting for freedom around the world more reminders of what is great about this country the thenhigh school graduate said A former high school classmate of Millers told the New York Times that the thenteenager would hit out at Spanishspeaking students for speaking anything other than English in the school halls He tended to make some of the Spanish language stuff very personal Moises Castillo told the newspaper There was a if youre not speaking English perhaps you should go somewhere else the former classmate said The senior advisers teenage views could provide some insight into his hardline stance today which has seen Miller push for a policy that would have legal immigrants penalized for using support programs such as food stamps by making it more difficult for them to become citizens or obtain green card

said is well aware of his heritage has become the architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our familys life in the US Glosser said he could not help but shudder at the thought of what would have happened to his ancestors had the same policies his nephew espousesthe travel ban the radical decrease in refugees the separation of children from their parents and even talk of limiting citizenship for legal immigrantsbeen in effect when WolfLeib made his desperate bid for freedom Acting for so long in the theater of rightwing politics Glosser said that Stephen and

Students who launched a campaign to tackle gun violence in America and who have received an international peace award for their efforts have urged the new congress to take up the challenge and work with them Floridas Stoneman Douglas High School pupils who formed March for Our Lives in the aftermath of the February shooting that left students and staff dead travelled to South Africa to receive the International Childrens Peace Prize Previous recipients included Pakistani girls education activist Malala Yousafzai and Nkosi Johnson a South African child who fought for the rights of children with HIV At the event in Cape Town held to coincide with Universal Childrens Day Bishop Desmond Tutu told representatives of the group David Hogg Emma Gonzalez Jaclyn Corin Matt Deitsch Ryan Deitsch and Delaney Tarr their work to persuade young people to become more engaged in confronting the crisis was among the most significant youthled mass movements in living memory The peaceful campaign to demand safe schools and communities and the eradication of gun violence is reminiscent of other great peace movements in history said Mr Tutu who is patron of the KidsRights Foundation which has organised the award for years and this year oversaw children from countries nominated I am in awe of these children whose powerful message is amplified by their youthful energy and an unshakable belief that children can no must improve their own futures During the ceremony Marc Dullaert founder of KidsRights and the International Childrens Peace Prize called on the international community to halt the surge in school violence witnessed internationally Schools must be protected as safe havens for children KidsRights calls upon the international community to halt this issue and to prevent schools from becoming battlegrounds he said Speaking from Cape Town the six young people told The Independent they had been inspired by their visit to South Africa and the chance to meet previous recipients Story continues Its an absolute honour to be up here with some incredible young people who have risen to the occasion time and time again said Matt Deitsch who dropped out of college to work for the movement after the shooting which his sister and younger brother survived We have only been doing this for nine months and to be here in this room with all of them was just incredible The young people who helped organise protests across the US and around the world highlighted the National Rifle Associations funding of many members of congress and held a rally in Washington DC to urge young people to become more involved While their efforts were widely praised some on the right accused them of being naive Conspiracy theorists even claimed the young people who had survived after gunman Nikolas Cruz a former student at the school entered the premises and opened fire were actors The young people including Mr Hogg and Ms Gonzalez gained support nationwide as they continued to press politicians with both passion and hard facts We are going to be the last mass shooting Ms Gonzalez told a crowd days after the shooting We are going to change the law Thats going to be Marjory Stoneman Douglas in that textbook and its all going to be due to the tireless efforts of the school board the faculty members the family members and most importantly the students Given that the group said it had struggled to engage with lots of Republican members of congress who had received funding from the NRA Ms Gonzalez was asked what message she might have for Nancy Pelosi After Democrats flipped the House of Representatives in the midterm elections it is likely the yearold will become speaker and the Democrats will have the opportunity to craft legislation Were saying to anyone who would listen to us not just Nancy Pelosi but the entire government at this point said Ms Gonzalez Included among the point plan listed on the groups website is a demand to disarm domestic abusers put in place tougher security for guns introduce universal background checks and provide grants for research into gun violence for the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention Yet the young people said the changes needed were not simply legislative Ryan Deitsch said the group had to continue trying to challenge the root of gun culture We have a culture that we have to fight which is very much a culture centred around guns and making them as normalised as possible in society and that is not just in America but around the world That is something that we have to combat That is something we have been combatting slowly he said That is something we are going to combat politically but we have to combat this culture And the way we do that is working with out chapters around the country and around the world This work is not going to end any time soon that we can see but we are prepared for the long haul,parkland students urge democrats to help end gun violence were prepared for the long haul We should stand up to gun violence not because it happened but because that is whats been happening right now The law is bad in California if you dont listen and in Oregon where were facing a massive

Dear Commissioner Elia Yesterday I proudly stood shoulder to shoulder with brave students and faculty who spoke out against gun violence History provides moments where real change is possible and the thousands of students who participated in organized walkouts all throughout the state are seizing the moment and admirably standing up for the safety of their classmates and students across the country In the last hours there have been several reports of New York State schools disciplining students and faculty for participating in yesterdays historic events to stop gun violence In at least one disturbing incident it was reported that the school physically blocked the exits to prevent students from demonstrating These actions send a terrible message to New Yorks children and are against constitutional free speech protections I call on you to use SEDs authority to stop these schools reverse course and cease any disciplinary actions Peaceful expression of views on controversial issues that is not disruptive or threatening is a right that all students have in this country and any attempts to stifle this speech violates the constitutional rights of students and faculty to free speech Threatening to discipline students for participating in the peaceful demonstrations is not only inappropriate it is unconstitutional Reports that schools may also discipline faculty are also highly concerning and would send a terrible message to our students The students who participated in the walkout are trying to advance laws and actions that would save their lives and many viewed their participation as necessary to their own safety The scourge of mass shootings in schools is very real and these students were taking proactive steps to protect themselves and their classmates These actions coupled with the peaceful manner in which the demonstrations were conducted is something that should be lauded not punished Additionally I call on you to thoroughly investigate any reports of schools that blocked the exits to physically prevent students from leaving during the event This an egregious safety violation and it is also unlawful Yesterdays actions were a testament to the courage and leadership of New Yorks students As I said yesterday these young people are showing more leadership than the socalled leaders in Washington To punish or discipline them is inconsistent with the freedom of expression that we cherish It would say more about the adults imposing discipline than it would about the students who exercised their rights to speak out Sincerely Governor Andrew M Cuomo,ny governor says schools should drop any punishment given to kids who joined gun violence protests or who used deadly force This does not though constitute legal punishment Read GunBan Laws for Unlawfully Guns Whos behind them,students walked out of the new york state capitol on wednesday The protesters and students were held after they made a free speech speech protest and walked off the street Police later arrested them on suspicion of disorderly conduct Earlier police said they would do everything in their power to block the march which was slated to continue into the morning Police said only one person was arrested for causing trouble and the other two were not arrested,1

Watch the Full Episode Above In its Season premiere South Park ditched ironic detachment for a bitter look at the depressing regularity of school shootings and the countrys refusal to do anything about them And yes despite the usual constant gags and the Bstorys Marvel riff in which Cartman becomes what amounts to a racist Jessica Jones the episode was a genuinely sober condemnation of apathy over public violence The episode called Dead Kids sees Colorado plagued by nearconstant school killing sprees that the people of South Park treat like expected inconveniences rather than a terrifying emergency All except for Stans mom Sharon who becomes increasingly despondent but is assumed by everyone else to just be hormonal Also ReadSouth Park Season Premiere to Feature a School Shooting Video The episode begins as the South Park fourth graders get their grades from a recent math test Immediately a shooting begins offscreen but class and teacher continue to argue over the test as the gunfire screams and response from police get louder The teacher even shouts explanations as police storm into the room Afterward the kids continue talking about the test while ignoring dead bodies police and the TV news reporters crowding the school Stans mom Sharon shows up sobbing with joy that Stan is still alive and takes him home Cartman immediately asks Jeez whats up Stans moms ass At home Sharon asks Stan to tell his dad Randy about his day Stan sheepishly admits he flunked the math test No the other thing Sharon says Oh the school shooting Stan replies Randy only cares that Stan wasnt the one who shot the school up and didnt get shot Sharon flips out about the fact that no one seems to care about school shootings and storms out of the room Whats up moms ass Stan asks Also

same bewilderment She flips out again after which Randy has a cry session with his friends tearfully explaining that he loves her but is so hurt by her behavior Hes convinced that Sharon is just freaking out because shes on her period and is selfishly taking it out on everyone else I turn on the TV and dread theyre going to announce another school shooting he says and its gonna set my wife off One of his friends suggests that maybe Randy consider this problem is bigger than your wifes period But only because it might be menopause instead To find out more about that Randy goes to talk to

shooting But its just a ruse to trick her into racing to the elementary school where she finds Randy wearing a white suit and singing a romantic song to her Meanwhile yet another shooting breaks out Randy keeps singing and the adults keep standing around even as bullets are flying into the room hitting several of them including Randy Afterward Randy staggers outside bloody and is told by his supportive friends that at least you tried Sharon demands to know whats going on Randy in a super compassionate voice brings up her menopause Sharon angrily tells him she isnt going through menopause and she knows because she just started her period Randy then asks her to at least consider then that her behavior might just have been hormonal She storms off again leaving Randy hurt and alone But at the end of the episode Sharon explains to Randy that upon reflection maybe she might have been hormonal after all She apologizes to Randy who weeps with joy and thanks her As this is happening Sharon gets a phone call telling her that theres been yet another shooting Stans been shot Sharon says Should we get down there asks Randy Sharon pauses trying to keep calm and says No Its not the end of the

There were a couple of remarkable moments Wednesday in Washington DC and later in Sunrise Fla a few miles from where people were slaughtered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last week The first was a televised meeting between President Trump and survivors and relatives of children killed in school shootings The second was a CNNhosted town hall that brought together survivors of the most recent massacre other local residents elected officials and a spokesperson for the National Rifle Assn There were frank discussions in both gatherings They made for good cathartic theater But the discussions were also meaningless as far as meaningful action is concerned Trump told the gathered relatives and survivors that he favors the Fix NICS Act which he endorsed last week to reward local governments that follow existing laws asking them to voluntarily submit names of people determined ineligible to own firearms to be added to federal background check databases The measure also would use financial incentives to force federal agencies to comply with the law In the greater scheme of our gun problem that is half a baby step but at least it moves in the right direction Advertisement This ultimately is a political issue Trump also argued for more firearms in schools to let teachers custodians guidance counselors and others who have gone through special training mount a counterattack against a gunman endorsing the romanticized view that when the action comes everyone gets to be a Charles Bronson movie character That is a deadly stupid idea as experts and the experienced keep telling us Trump also tweeted Thursday morning that he supports comprehensive background checks which he didnt define and would consider raising the minimum age for buying rifles to from the present the Parkland gunman bought his ARstyle rifle legally If Trump meant he endorses a move to universal background checks that would be a welcome currently private transfers are not covered under federal law though California and many other states have their own tighter requirements But more than an hour after tweeting that Trump also tweeted a love note to the NRA which strongly supported his candidacy and which opposes universal background checks Advertisement What many people dont understand or dont want to understand is that Wayne Chris and the folks who work so hard at the are Great People and Great American Patriots They love our Country and will do the right thing MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Donald J Trump February So dont expect meaningful White House action on that any time soon This gets at the fundamental problem with trying to push through common sense gun control laws such as universal background checks let alone more controversial measures such as banning semiautomatic firearms altogether The GOP and the NRA are locked in step to oppose tightening access to firearms and Democrats are not united on the need for more stringent controls The NRA and its allies have a lot of political power and they use it ruthlessly Anyone from average citizen to elected official who expresses a contrary view to the NRAs a gunineverypocket worldview gets blasted In fact Wayne LaPierre the head of the NRA told the conservative CPAC group Thursday morning that socalled European socialists are trying to take over the government and that those seeking to limit access to firearms hate individual freedom Advertisement No In fact we embrace individual freedom But we do condemn the idea that one persons ability to own a gun trumps everyone elses freedom to go about their daily business without having to worry about getting shot And tying gun control advocates to the invention that socialists are trying to take over the government is little more than reborn McCarthyism Still the solution to our gun problem is as simple as it is difficult to achieve Countering the electoral and lobbying power of the NRA and its allies This ultimately is a political issue As I wrote Tuesday you have to admire the Parkland high school survivors who have sparked national protests over inaction on school shootings But protests wont do it It will take political pressure and direct campaigns to unseat elected officials who refuse to put the safety of their constituents ahead of their dogmatic embrace of the nd Amendment and their fealty to the NRA and its allies

cathartic but change nothing and we need the evidence to prove otherwise Theres an ongoing political debate and in the wake of the Newtown school massacre the number of people killed has risen

chat They even critiqued Cruzs rifle grip He posted a short video of himself shooting a rifle outside a window at night The video cuts out shortly after the round is fired A screenshot from a video showing Nikolas Cruz firing a gun out of a window They discussed which guns they liked better Ms or AKs At one point one member told Cruz Nick get this for your AR He directed Nick to a website offering an aftermarket accessory that would turn his AR into a fully automatic weapon A law enforcement source speaking to CNNs Evan Perez said that the gun used in the school shooting was not automatic and theres no indication he bought the accessory or a similar type of accessory When it was payday Cruz let the group know where the money was going to be spent Guys I got paid I am buying body armor he wrote Nikolas Cruz modeling his body armor Cruz did purchase the body armor according to receipts he posted in the chat with a discount and free shipping Then he asked the group whether it was legal to wear body armor to school School shooters he replied when someone asked why he wanted to know I think I am going to kill people The bio on one of his Instagram accounts read annihilator At one point in the chat he wrote I think I am going to kill people After a member told him not to say things like that he said he was just playing During one of the antiSemitic rants in the chat Cruz spoke of his birth mother saying My real mom was a Jew I am glad I never met her Roger and Lynda Cruz adopted Cruz when he was a child Roger died in and Lynda died last fall after an illness In his first message to the chat group Cruz bragged about writing a letter to President Donald Trump and receiving a response CNN reached out to the White House for comment about any

So many candidates for Congress particularly women are running on this issue not just making it part of their platform and not just supporting it but actually running on it said Shannon Watts founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America the grassroots arm of Everytown for Gun Safety Everytown which is largely funded by Michael Bloomberg has endorsed candidates this year in states and more than volunteers for Moms Demand Action are running for office On the road with the Parkland activists One of them is Amber Gustafson who was the groups Iowa leader in the runup to the election A gun owner and former Republican Ms Gustafson is now challenging the majority leader of the Iowa Senate as a Democrat She went from Republican to independent in and registered as a Democrat in driven mainly by her views on health care and guns She said she discussed gun policy with every voter she visited I say Im a gun owner and I always put my hand over my heart and I care about the Second Amendment but I also want to make sure that guns do not fall into the hands of people who shouldnt have them she said She supports universal background checks and redflag laws which would allow the temporary removal of guns if a persons relatives or law enforcement attest that they pose an immediate threat She emphasizes that her opponent State Senator Jack Whitver supported a bill that would have dismantled Iowas permitting system for gun purchases Some of this years guncontrol candidates are like Ms Gustafson gun owners who hope that will give them more credibility with some voters on the fence about restrictions Mr Crow a hunter who served in Iraq and Afghanistan likes to emphasize that he has used weapons of war and had them used against me Ive never needed an M or AR or anything like it to deer duck or rabbit hunt Mr Crow said Nor would I need a weapon like that to defend my home or my family here in the United States Tyler Sandberg a spokesman for Mr Coffman the Republican incumbent called bans on specific types of firearms or magazines extreme He added that Mr Coffman supported redflag laws and had helped to write a bill that would offer federal grants for state redflag programs as well as a school security bill,bearing fs from the nra some democrats are campaigning openly on guns I find what I hear to be somewhat misleading A few of my fellow democrats are actually saying publicly that they are opposed to guns For example Sen Bernie Sanders IVT and Sen Rob Portman ROH One such politician Bob Graham RFL is a member of the House Judiciary Committee Graham stated I am the,amber gustafson a guncontrol activist is challenging the majority leader of the iowa senate Thats whats bothering most Americans said Bill Polamay who heads the Iowans for Life Campaign If I was really concerned that a Republican candidate running for governor would vote to close gun loopholes and let the loophole holders own guns Id say thats unacceptable I certainly think theyre pushing back strongly on his statement because they,1
Chicago police Cmdr Paul Bauer was shot and killed near the Thompson Center in the Loop on Feb Editorial Board Editorials reflect the opinion of the Editorial Board as determined by the members of the board the editorial page editor and the publisher For a long time Thomas Caldwell behaved like a man who wanted to go to prison and wouldnt stop until he got his way In August he pleaded guilty to selling guns without a federal license and now faces a prison sentence of up to five years The question is why he wasnt locked up sooner One of the firearms the Wisconsin man sold illegally was a mm Glock semiautomatic pistol that eventually wound up in the hands of a fourtime felon named Shomari Legghette In February he was fleeing Chicago police on foot in the Loop when he was tackled by police Cmdr Paul Bauer In the ensuing struggle authorities say Legghette fired seven rounds inflicting fatal wounds on the officer Anyone who makes a regular business of selling guns is supposed to obtain a federal firearms dealer license Anyone buying from a licensed dealer has to submit to a background check that screens out those who are legally barred from gun ownership such as felons Caldwell however bought and sold dozens of guns a year without a license and peddled them through a website that doesnt require users to prove identity and undergo background checks That activity brought him to the attention of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives the Tribunes Jeremy Gorner and Annie Sweeney reported In the ATF sent him a letter warning him not to sell more guns until he got a license He agreed but didnt stop In the agency traced another gun to Caldwell and found he was still posting hundreds of firearms for sale online Undercover ATF agents arranged to go to his home where they bought a pistol He wasnt charged with a crime though until later after Bauer was shot In the aftermath of that death the ATF visited Caldwells home and found he was still plying his trade without a license telling agents that selling firearms was like an addiction as an assistant US attorney said Even then he kept selling finally earning his date in federal court Why didnt the ATF move sooner to get prosecutors to put this chronic dangerous scofflaw behind bars The agency declined to comment the Tribune reported This case shows the need for stricter enforcement of federal firearms licensing laws which are meant to prevent people from operating as gun dealers without following sensible rules The laws are also meant to block sales to prohibited buyers The largely unregulated private gun market makes it much too easy for shady sellers and criminal buyers to find each other Thats a good reason for Congress to pass legislation requiring federal background checks for all firearm purchases rather than let private sellers continue to operate on the honor system If Caldwell had been prosecuted when he first appeared on the ATFs radar Paul Bauer might be alive today Thats a tragedy and a disgrace The feds should take it as unforgettable proof of the urgent need for tougher enforcement Join the discussion on Twitter TribEdBoard and on Facebook Submit a letter to the editor here or email letters com ,the deadly peril of not enforcing gun laws for some she said This is an important election year to build trust and help Americans learn lessons from these deadly incidents She said Democrats had been defying law enforcement to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous criminals while at the same time showing the public that it was our responsibility to protect our safety,the chicago police chief paul bauer left and the police chief scott m dolan in court in august The officers were facing charges of burglary and weapons possession including burglary and a battery of a police officer as well as reckless driving Prosecutors are seeking more than million in bail against the officers with the city claiming more than of the money is owed by city employees The officers are expected,0
Garden provides place to mourn Las Vegas shooting victims By regina garcia cano associated press LAS VEGAS Sep PM ET The Associated Press In this Friday Sept photo a photo of Las Vegas shooting victim Erick Silva center hangs on a wall at a memorial garden under construction in Las Vegas The small garden is home to photos crosses ribbons and dozens of other items placed in memory of the people who were killed on Oct in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history For their families and those who survived the massacre at a country music festival this garden created by volunteers in the days that followed is a place to mourn and heal AP PhotoJohn Locher An image of Angelica Cervantes son donning a blackandyellow security guard Tshirt is one of dozens of smiling photos tacked to walls in a Las Vegas garden decorated with ribbons cowboy boots horseshoes and rubber bracelets Cervantes visits every other week to gaze at the photo that has withstood the desert sun for almost a year and to ask her son Erick Silva to watch over her his stepfather and his siblings Cuidanos she begs him sometimes tearfully Silva was one of people killed Oct in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history For their families and those who survived the massacre at a country music festival this garden created by volunteers in the days that followed is a place to mourn and heal It gave me a space to talk with him and he is there with his angels Cervantes said referring to the other victims Sometimes I come across another mother there Some ask me how he was Talking about him makes me proud Among the bright lights of the Las Vegas Strip theres no indication of the bloodshed that took place there a year ago The festival grounds are fenced and green screens block any views to the inside The flowers flags wreaths and other items that crowded a nearby road median and the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign have long been removed Today the garden with trees one for each victim plus an oak representing life is the only permanent public space in the Las Vegas area created in memory of the victims It sits a few feet from a bus stop and an adult store and miles from the shooting site The quarteracre space was slated to be a dog park but in the days after the shooting the dirt lot was leveled concrete bricks placed and trees shrubs purple pansies red and white roses and bright pink petunias were planted A Remembrance Wall was hammered together from wooden pallets The wooden wall was recently replaced with a set of metal and fauxwood structures The photos and several items from the original wall were transferred over A fountain is now working and a bluestone sculpture of a pair of angel wings bearing the initials of each victim was recently added Volunteers on Saturday planted dozens of colorful flowers around the garden Some people later took videos of their walks around the garden A pair left red roses next to photos of some of the victims while a man brought his guitar and played soothing notes Many survivors of the shooting are in Las Vegas this weekend for a large private reunion and other planned events ahead of the oneyear anniversary Monday Throughout the year some friends and relatives have decorated the tree of their loved one A laminated photo of Arizona Diamondbacks players honoring Christiana Duarte is tied to one tree while another one has decorated river stones for Hannah Ahlers Cervantes previously left a Tshirt and flowers A museum is storing the original wall and mementos left at the garden that can be damaged by weather while volunteers at another museum have catalogued more than items left at makeshift memorials last October A small sample of those thousands of items including cowboy boots hats stuffed animals and candles recently went on display A committee chaired by Nevada Gov Brian Sandoval will work to design fund and build a permanent memorial If history holds it will be years before it is completed Almost a decade went by before a memorial for the victims of the Columbine High School massacre was finished while a committee just last month agreed on a design for the memorial for Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims The practice of honoring the dead with makeshift memorials and roadside shrines is not new but storing the items left behind is Ashley Maynor who has researched community responses to tragedies said both are ways of processing grief After a tragedy of this magnitude that reveals something so disturbing about human character people want to do something to reaffirm their humanity to reaffirm goodness in the world and to feel like they have some agency in the face of something incomprehensible said Maynor a digital scholarship librarian at New York University The need to do something drove Jay Pleggenkuhle and his business partner to sketch the garden on a napkin and ask the city for the space for a popup park Businesses and individuals immediately stepped up to help and a year later they continue to do so Cervantes whose son was her right hand and loved Halloween and burritos will return to the garden Oct when the name of every victim will be read during a ceremony A lot of the family members have come back and spent time at the garden Pleggenkuhle said One victim in particular her parents live in Redding California and every time they come to Las Vegas

CNN President Donald Trump is making a fresh if unexpected push for some gun law reforms following a tragic mass shooting last week in Florida but its not clear they will be embraced by Republican leaders on Capitol Hill nor rankandfile conservatives who have long stood against diminishing gun rights House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have said little publicly since a former student massacred people at a high school in Parkland about what Congress could do to address the epidemic of school shootings with legislation to reduce gun violence In the wake of these types of tragedies both Republican leaders regularly tout their longstanding positions that enforcing existing gun laws and addressing mental health issues not imposing new limits to gun ownership should be the focus With the GOP majority in the House and potentially even the Senate at risk in Novembers midterm elections any move by Ryan or McConnell to alienate progun rights base voters who they need to be enthusiastic and show up in large numbers at the polls is politically tricky and not one they are ready to take In addition the vast majority of GOP lawmakers who are out of town for a week long recess oppose most gun control measures and are not pressing their leaders for action Trump has repeatedly insisted in recent days he wants to get something done to address safety in schools Unlike for many years where people sitting in my position did not take action they didnt take proper action they took no action at all were going to take action Trump said during a meeting with law enforcement officials at the White House when the President also offered support for raising the legal age to purchase guns getting rid of bump fire stocks a controversial gun accessory that allows it to fire more rapidly and focusing on mental health reforms I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health Raise age to and end sale of Bump Stocks Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue I hope Donald J Trump February But Trumps shifting positions on gun proposals make it difficult for congressional Republicans to know whether they would get any political cover with a base that continues to stand by core beliefs to protect the Second Amendment Something the President says he backs today could easily be reversed in a new tweet tomorrow If Trump truly wants to have the GOPled House and Senate pass these reforms he will need to make a sustained push and be prepared to use his political capital to get it done over the objections of powerful interest groups like the National Rifle Association National polls show that a majority of Americans do support some targeted gun control measures such as beefing up the background check system but many GOP lawmakers say they are not feeling any pressure from voters in solidly red districts or states back home One thing they do hear from their constituents many of whom are singleissue voters is that they will oppose those who change the laws Immediately following the shooting Ryan argued it wasnt appropriate to wade into another divisive debate but instead called for unity for those affected This is one of those moments where we just need to step back and count our blessings he told reporters a day after the events unfolded at a press conference on Capitol Hill We need to think less about taking sides and fighting each other politically and just pulling together This House and the whole country stands with the Parkland community Few House Republicans pressed for any legislative fixes Moderate Florida GOP Rep Carlos Curbelo who is in one of the most competitive House districts has pressed for a floor vote on his bipartisan bill to ban bump stocks the tool that can be used to make a semiautomatic gun perform like an automatic weapon and supports a bill to allow federal research on gun violence Another House GOP member Rep Lee Zeldin of New York called for hearings A day after the Parkland shooting McConnell took to the Senate floor to condemn the vicious act praise the heroism of first responders and send prayers to the victims But he made no mention of a need for a legislative response one dealing with curbs on guns or other root causes of these crimes such as mental health To say that such brutal pointless violence is unconscionable is an understatement the Kentucky Republican said Schools should be places where children can learn and faculty and staff can work without fear of violence The top GOP senator is keenly aware there is not much appetite in his largely conservative conference for even the modest reforms Trump appears to be embracing much less the sweeping gun law changes many Democrats champion The elites dont care not one whip about Americas school system and school children LaPierre told the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday Their goal is to eliminate the second amendment and our firearms freedoms so they can eradicate all individual freedoms Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer responded The NRA is once again spewing pathetic out of touch ideas blaming everything but guns the Democratic leaders said in a statement The real test of President Trump and the Republican Congress is not words and empathy but action Will President Trump and the Republicans finally buck the NRA and get something done Could this time be different Florida GOP Sen Marco Rubio a longtime opponent of gun control measures publicly signaled he was revising his own positions at a CNN town hall on Wednesday night coming out in favor of banning gun sales to yearolds who can now buy rifles and potentially limiting the size of ammunition clips One retiring lawmaker Arizona Sen Jeff Flake announced he was working on a bill to up the age for those purchasing guns to but there has been no rush from other Republicans to jump on board or call for votes Ryan a Wisconsin Republican pointed to the legislation to fix the National Instant Background Check System also called NICS that the House approved in December after another mass shooting in Texas exposed holes in the system that failed to flag a former service member to the database for his record of domestic violence The bill passed narrowly because all except six House Democrats opposed the measure it was paired with a bill to loosen gun restrictions to allow those with permits to carry concealed weapons to legally travel with those firearms to other states The unusual public profile of those high school students who survived the shooting and the increased public pressure had House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi point to their role as a tipping point in the debate over gun legislation They are doing a historic thing and I think they will make a big difference channeling their grief their sorrow their anger really to save lives Pelosi said adding that all we are asking for is the speaker is to give us a vote We believe here is bipartisan support for improving the background check bill But the response from top Hill Republicans leaders is similar to the ones they have had in recent mass shootings in Las Vegas in Sutherland Springs Texas in Orlando Florida Five years after the stunning murder of elementary school children and their teachers in Newtown Connecticut Congress returns to the same debate over and over The wide gulf in ideological views of the two parties has not changed and the cautious response from GOP leaders continue to reflect that dynamic The only force that might be able to change it is Trump himself If the President decides to fully embrace the reforms he is touting he might be able to get congressional Republicans to buy in,will paul ryan mitch mcconnell embrace trumps gun reforms Trump tweeted Sunday morning that the president was just wrong to fire former FBI Director James Comey suggesting some may be sympathetic to him Trump who has consistently criticized Comey and his refusal to testify in front of congressional committees responded Saturday night with tweets in which he called the FBI director a disgrace for not bringing up his own charges even though the investigation concluded his investigation ,senator mitch mcconnell the majority leader at a news conference on thursday Theyre saying we need to step aside but theyre saying thats not what we have to do said Senator Scott Fitzgerald a Republican from Indiana People will say you dont have to step in but the fact of the matter is we need to take action to ensure that we have an open and safe government I think thats what they wanted us to do,1

Kyle Kashuv is a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida but his views are different from most of his peers who participated in the March for Our Lives rallies An estimated people marched in favor of tighter gun restrictions in Washington DC on Saturday as part of a national and international movement prompted by the massacre at MSD The movement was organized by victims who survived the mass killing On Sunday Kashuv told CBS Face The Nation that he wants to see sensible solutions to prevent school violence But he also firmly believes the Second Amendment must be protected Theres a silent minority at Stoneman Douglas who agrees with me completely he said Does he believe his voice is being heard Kashuv said student voices like his are being shut out of the conversation And what I saw at the march yesterday which really frustrated me is that I have a different point of view but what really concerned me was that how come I wasnt invited to speak at the march because as Americans we all have different point of views And its important to represent them all equally he said A ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines will not solve the issue Kashuv said Instead he blames the mass killing on law enforcements failures to enforce already existing laws and practices And I find it ironic that after all this and weve seen so many different government failures we want to trust the government even more Kashuv said Are more guards the answer A possible solution is more armed guards in schools he said The Marshal Program in Florida for example allows properly trained officers veterans and unemployed veterans get training in protecting schools Kashuv said Asked if hed like to see more armed guards at his school Kashuv said Absolutely I mean we saw it Maryland He stopped the shooter He did his job and had the cowards of Broward done their job I think that the count in Parkland would have been much lower We saw that in Maryland that a good guy with a gun stopped the bad guy with the gun The only way to stop an active shooter on campus is to have another person to eliminate him Kashuv said he he is concerned that lawmakers could enact laws that will hurt the American public at large We have to make sure that the laws that were enacting dont hurt America on a national scale he said And thats why I think that we have to sit down with all members of this issue Okay sit down with me and David Hogg or Cameron Kasky and debate this and find a common middle ground because thats the only way that were going to protect the American people,parkland student and second amendment advocate asks why he wasnt invited to speak at weekend rally pictwittercomhSkJXXVlS Chris Ritter November The University of Florida student whose protest was deemed illegal by the city and state on Tuesday has taken to the Internet to attack the event with a Facebook status update ,kyle kashuv a student at marjory stoneman douglas high school in florida spoke at a rally on sunday Just after being fired we said we want you to be fired he recalled laughing Whats your job at that university Being a teacher to the entire world Very disappointing But the students supporters say the firing was a very disappointing move It doesnt reflect who,1

A white man who fatally shot Indian national Srinivas Kuchibhotla and wounded two other men at a restaurant in northeastern Kansas last year has been sentenced to life in prison federal prosecutors announced Tuesday Witnesses said the gunman Adam Purinton angrily confronted Kuchibhotla and another Indian national Alok Madasani at an Austins Bar Grill in Olathe Kansas yelling Get out of my country Purinton then shot eight rounds inside the restaurant killing Kuchibhotla and wounding his friend Madasani A third man identified as Kansas resident Ian Grillot was also shot after he tried to stop Purinton outside the bar Before shooting Purinton reportedly asked the men who he thought were Iranian about their immigration status When he was located by police at a bar more than miles away from the crime scene he told officers he had killed two Middle Eastern men In May Purinton agreed to a plea deal that recommended the maximum sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the hate crime and firearm offenses against him In turn prosecutors agreed to not pursue a death sentence No matter who you are what you believe or how you worship you should be able to live without fear of becoming a victim of hate crimes We hope todays sentencing brings some closure for the victims and their families US Attorney Stephen McAllister for the District of Kansas said Tuesday in a statement The new sentence comes on top of a separate life sentence given to Purinton after he pleaded guilty to state charges of murder and attempted murder All the counts are to be served consecutively according to court documents Heres what else we know Prosecutors have pointed to an earlier incident weeks before the shooting In its statement today the Justice Department said that Purinton admitted in open court at his federal guiltyplea hearing months ago that he targeted and shot Kuchibhotla and Madasani because of their race color and national origin In a statement from the department in May prosecutors also pointed to a separate incident weeks before the shooting Purinton happened to be at Austins Bar Grill at the same time as Kuchibhotla and Madasani sitting by himself in the bar area while the two Indian men were having a drink on the patio All three were known to frequent the restaurant after work Noticing the two men Purinton commented to a regular sitting at the bar Did you see the terrorists on the patio according to the statement How did the shooting happen On the evening of Feb Purinton was sitting by himself on the front patio of Austins Bar Grill Kuchibhotla and Madasani were also sitting nearby He then approached to two men demanding to know their immigration statuses Out of the blue comes this weirdlooking gentleman I say weirdlooking because he had anger on his face Madasani later told The New York Times I did not hear what he was saying instantly but I saw the look on Srinivass face change drastically I looked at Adam and he walked towards me he came to me and said Are you here legally According to DOJ Purinton poked Kuchibhotla in the chest calling him a terrorist and other racist epithets Witnesses at one point heard Purinton shout Get out of my country Ian Grillot and another bar patron interceded and escorted Purinton out of the bar Everybody kept coming up to us saying This is not what we represent you guys belong here Everybody kept coming up to us saying This is not what we represent you guys belong here Madasani recounted for the Times saying that other patrons assured them that he and his friend were welcomed at the bar Purinton however drove home to retrieve a semiautomatic pistol He changed into a different shirt and wore a blue and white scarf all in an effort to disguise his identity the DOJ said About minutes later he returned and shot eight rounds at Kuchibhotla and Madasani on the patio Four of the bullets struck Kuchibhotla who later died from his injuries Madasani was shot once but survived As Purinton fled the scene Grillot tried to catch him Purinton shot Grillot who also survived the attack After the shooting Purinton stated over the phone to a friend and later in person to a bartender that he had just killed some Iranians the DOJ said The fallout The attack raised concerns about antiimmigrant sentiment in the US and even caught the attention of Indian officials They and local media wondered if America was a safe place for Indians Sunayana Dumala Kuchibhotlas widow addressed this in court today via a statement that was read by a prosecutor Dumala wrote that it was extremely painful to face the gunman She did address Purinton directly in the statement If you could have kept your anger inside and spoke to my husband softly Srinu would have been more than happy to share his background and help you understand that not every brown skinned person is suspicious or evil but kind smart and contributing to America she wrote Instead you chose to rage and bully in anger and when you were stopped you decided to take their lives she added None of the victims were present for the sentencing The Kansas City Star reported In a video produced by the Star after Purintons sentencing in May Dumala said the murder of my husband will not bring back Srinu to me but it will send out a very strong message that hate is never acceptable Attorney General Jeff Sessions also called the hate crime detestable in todays statement While we cannot undo the irreparable harm that this defendant has done some measure of justice for the victims families has been achieved Such hateful crimes will remain a priority for the Department of Justice he said READ MORE important stories that deserve a closer look,kansas man sentenced to life in prison for shooting

up American politics its up there with abortion and immigration and they need to be very careful said a former Democratic leadership aide If a Democratic candidate or the party as a whole overextends on this issue then it becomes incredibly easy for the Republicans to play that up in a lot of districts Its easier to demagogue on this than to do something about it the aide added and you risk overreaching as a party if you try to make it a onesizefitsall issue Just a day after the Florida shootings Pelosi pressed for quick action on three modest proposals creating a special committee to examine gun violence expanding background checks before almost all gun sales and empowering federal researchers to study gun violence as a public health issue research thats currently banned A House leadership aide said Monday that those proposals were highlighted because they existed at that moment and Democratic leaders are open to expanding their legislative wish list based on the sentiments of the broader caucus The National Rifle Association NRA is going to attack everything the current aide noted downplaying the dangers of an assertive push for expansive reforms like the assault

major reforms are unlikely under a GOPcontrolled Congress If were in the majority of course the legislation changes the second aide said Democrats history with gun reform is checkered Under former President Clinton they enacted a year ban on assault weapons but it was widely viewed as a factor helping to secure George W Bushs White House victory six years later Aside from legislation designed to encourage more background check reporting a measure adopted in the wake of the shooting massacre at Virginia Tech the same year they largely abandoned the issue Indeed when Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee requested background check hearings in when they controlled the gavel they were refused Pelosi defended that decision this month saying it was a practical one The votes to pass the

What can we learn about the current debate over guns from earlier public health crises Photo illustration Yahoo News photos Getty Images background from top left Nam Y HuhAP MediaPunchIPXAP Alex BrandonAP Joe SkipperAP MediaPunchIPXAP Nam Y HuhAP Hoomecom MediaPunchAP Manuel ValdesAP Survivors of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Fla joined the chorus of Americans denouncing the National Rifle Associations NRA influence on elected officials over the gun control issue But will this moment lead to substantive change in the nations gun laws or will it be subsumed into Washingtons larger gridlock forgotten until the next school shooting as has happened repeatedly in the past There may be a clue in the history of the regulation of another dangerous product cigarettes Guncontrol groups say the firearms industry is using some of the same tactics the tobacco lobby used to forestall regulations for most of the th century including the suppression of potentially damaging research and casting the issue in terms of rights and freedom But the record shows that over the course of several decades and over the wellfunded opposition of a powerful industry publichealth advocates mostly prevailed in the battle against smoking The tobacco industry is built on profiting from a product that kills and causes disease for hundreds of thousands of Americans Unfortunately the same is true for the gun industry While there are legitimate uses for firearms for example in the military for the most part firearms particularly assault weapons are marketed to civilians in a way which increases and continues a legacy of death and injury Mark Pertschuk former president of Americans for Nonsmokers Rights and former legislative director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence said to Yahoo News A study published in the American Journal of Medicine in February found that Americans are times more likely than citizens of other developed countries to be shot and killed Researchers from Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and the University of Nevada at Reno analyzed World Health Organization mortality data for highincome nations Though the US only had half the population of the other nations combined Americans accounted for percent of all gun deaths Gunmurder rates are times higher in the US than in similar wealthy nations The US also accounted for percent of all women young adults under and children killed with a gun Story continues The analogy isnt only to the tobacco industry Trade groups have clear missions to support the interests of their industries they represent But public health advocates take issue when misinformation is knowingly propagated and from their perspective profits are privileged over people For instance CocaCola and other soda companies long promoted the notion that exercise rather than healthful nutrition choices could solve the obesity epidemic They still challenge soda taxes and other initiatives intended to reduce consumption Barron Lerner a professor of medicine and public health at NYU Langone Health said the tobacco industrys mission for many years was to obfuscate the data that shows cigarette smoking causes lung cancer Although the tobacco industry lobbied in Washington he said its greatest accomplishment wasnt buying the cooperation of members of Congress or finding advocates from tobaccogrowing states so much as it was complicating the issue creating enough doubt in the public to delay the implementation of antismoking measures There are historical moments where things get so bad the carnage is so much and the rhetoric is so absurd that theres finally movement Lerner told Yahoo News I think were ready for some type of a similar movement in the world of guns In the midth century nearly half of all adult Americans smoked cigarettes which were considered cool and glamorous Smoking rates have steadily declined from percent of American adults in to percent in and many now consider cigarettes disgusting and socially distasteful What changed In short the health hazards became widely known A major turning point for cigarettes came in January when the Surgeon Generals Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health released its landmark report which definitively linked cigarettes and lung cancer discrediting the tobacco companies attempts to cast doubt on the link The science on cigarette smoking led directly to public health measures to mitigate harm higher taxes public service announcements warning labels on the packages smokefree areas etc The cigarette companies eventually had to publicly apologize after published correspondence clearly showed that they had lied to and misled the American people Cliff Douglas vice president for tobacco control at the American Cancer Society and an attorney was involved in landmark litigation against the tobacco industry in the s He said the tobacco industrys lobbyists and attorneys with whom he dealt directly are experts at changing the subject just like the character Nick Naylor from Thank You for Smoking They would much rather discuss freedom and rights than cigarettes or guns he said They are masterful at spinning the web and distracting from the key issues which is that their products are killing people and that the industry actually has the ability to change the whole dynamic You can make the products safer or not market them the way you do There are so many decision points for them but instead they shift the burden to us to defend restricting peoples freedom Back in December Douglas said the CEOs for the major cigarette companies initiated a halfcentury long conspiracy to cover up the dangers of smoking These companies were found guilty of racketeering in federal court in They created false science misled the public about the health impact of their products delayed policy change by influencing the political process and distracted from the reality of the epidemic of death that their business was responsible for Thats very dramatic sounding but its factual Douglas said What I see is a direct line of comparison between that political and public relations strategy and that of the gun industry In the mids Douglas was responsible for an expos on ABC News about the tobacco industrys manipulation of nicotine levels in cigarettes to get consumers addicted The story prompted tobacco company Philip Morris to sue for libel Facing the possibility of billion in damages ABC News publicly apologized Fastforward to today Thanks to the ruling tobacco companies are legally obligated to run primetime TV ads with corrective messages such as cigarette companies intentionally designed cigarettes with enough nicotine to create and sustain addiction that effectively corroborate Douglass thesis In the early s there was a push for a similar public health approach to reducing the high rate of gun deaths Physician Arthur Kellermann published several articles in the New England Journal of Medicine arguing that if a product is killing and injuring Americans then public health officials should find sciencebased approaches to reduce the harm Perhaps waiting periods gun registration locking up guns in homes and other steps could reduce deaths he suggested His intent was to depoliticize the issue But as you might have noticed guns have not been depoliticized at all There are several important distinctions between tobacco and guns Cigarette use was prevalent across virtually all demographics in the US during the industrys golden years But gun ownership diverges strongly along rural and urban lines a divide thats been exploited in the culture war Theres probably a small percentage of people giving away their guns because theyre disgusted Most people who have guns and use them properly love their guns Thats another cultural difference Lerner said That makes it harder to stigmatize guns Cigarettes became stigmatized People who didnt smoke hated them People who did smoke wished they didnt Theres also the issue of research Whereas there are reams of government studies about tobacco lung cancer and heart disease the Dickey Amendment of which mandates that no government funding may be used to advocate or promote gun control effectively prevents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC from even studying gun violence There have been numerous efforts to repeal it and former Rep Jay Dickey RArk now regrets introducing the legislation Theres less science available to prove what sort of strategies might be effective for gun control as a result of the law Lerner said That cuts out one of the legs of the stool of a public health approach Lerners book One for the Road recounts the national debate over another publichealth menace drunk driving pitting those who campaigned for education and legislation against those who thought the problem was overregulated and exaggerated The book explores the reasons drunk driving deaths remained stubbornly high for decades the alcohol lobby backlash against Prohibition insufficient public transit and the publics beliefs about individualism civil liberties and civic responsibility In meaningful ways the drunk driving debates foreshadowed the cigarette and gun issues The word freedom is often used People called the car the freedom machine The idea in the United States is that since we celebrate our independence and frontier spirit means you should be allowed to do all these things Lerner said The word freedom with guns is constantly used An illustrative headline emblazoned across the NRAs registration page reads Its not just about guns Its about freedom The rates of drunkdriving deaths in the s were enormously high because there were no regulations and poorly enforced laws But in the early s there was a massive antidrunk driving movement led by groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving MADD Armed with data about fatalities they fought for tougher laws and stigmatized drunk driving In the vast majority of cases when scientists and researchers made a good case for a public health approach to a problem things really changed Tobacco drunk driving absolutely There was data These were respected scientists and to some degree the issues became depoliticized Lerner said The Pew Research Center found that despite sharp divisions over concealed carry and other issues Republicans and Democrats largely agree on several modest gun safety measures such as conducting background checks for private gun sales and prohibiting people with mental illness or on nofly lists from purchasing guns One problem that has stymied grassroots efforts to effect change at the local level is state preemption of local laws In the s the cigarette industry started fighting to establish statewide smoking laws that would supersede local jurisdictions making it impossible for local governments to pass tougher smoking laws They were opposed by antismoking activists who overturned state preemption laws so that today only states preempt local governments from passing ordinances related to smoking In stark contrast nearly all states preempt local governments from passing local gun laws Hawaii California Illinois New York New Jersey Connecticut and Massachusetts do not preempt local governments The rest do The NRA borrowed this strategy of promoting state preemption of local laws from the cigarette industry back in the s when grassroots movements for gun control were strong Yahoo News contacted the NRA to get its perspective on these comparisons We asked what the organization thinks of the claim that the gun industry like the cigarette industry before it has suppressed information about the dangers of its product and prevented necessary measures to protect the public NRA spokesman Lars Dalseide responded I realize its a constant misconception and often misreported in the press but the NRA represents individual gun owners while the National Shooting Sports Foundation NSSF represents the gun industry Our members are people while their members are the Smith Wessons Bass Pro Shops and the average AAA Gun Stores of the world The NRA presents itself as a voice for million gun owners But a report from the Violence Policy Center called Blood Money How the Gun Industry Bankrolls the NRA revealed that the NRA received between million and million from all corporate partners between and The majority of this money percent came from the gun industry Josh Sugarmann executive director of the Violence Policy Center told Yahoo News Todays NRA is a gun industry trade association masquerading as a shooting sports foundation Through direct payments and sponsorship deals tens of millions of dollars flow to the NRA from its financial patrons in the firearms industry To argue otherwise is to deny reality The NSSF did not respond to requests for comment Alan Gottlieb founder of the Second Amendment Foundation and a conservative activist said guns and cigarettes are a completely different story He said people conflate these topics to demonize guns because they would like to prohibit guns or pass more regulations The difference is the cigarette industry suppressed information that really affected public health because ingestion of the cigarette smoke tar and nicotine obviously had a public health consequence to peoples bodies People dont eat or digest guns People dont eat or digest bullets Gottlieb told Yahoo News Guns dont cause diseases Cigarettes cause cancer Thats a significant difference He endorsed the position that cigarettes kill people when they are used properly whereas guns when used properly do not kill anyone According to Gottlieb the gun industry unlike the cigarette industry has gone out of its way to explain safety and how particular guns function Yes there are innocent people who are murdered by guns But there are also lots of innocent people who are alive today because they had a gun to defend themselves Gottlieb said They want to ignore that side of the equation The Tobacco Atlas recently published by the American Cancer Society and Vital Strategies found that the tobacco industry is increasingly targeting emerging markets in Africa Asia and the Middle East where regulations arent as strong At a broad strokes level what both industries do is prey on vulnerability and ignorance Douglas said They manipulate the information environment to steer those who know less to actually believe in falsehoods In other words they traffic in fake news and people buy it Read more

On the school side limiting studentteacher ratios to to in each classroom ensures that young people are connected to each other and caring adults As a high school teacher I currently have four classes that max out at and two that max out at The difference is night and day In the smaller classes the students proactively participate know and respect each other much more and are simply happier human beings This reduces the chance of alienation a key reason why too many rogue classmates have opened fire on their peers,two ways to curb gun violence smaller clips and classes not sure where the rules were added and increasing violence on an almost weekly basis In order to prevent gun violence it is necessary to have guns locked up so that no one will use them or attempt to rob or otherwise force anyone who gets too close But such locks are not effective deterrents In addition to restricting gun ownership we must also increase gun violence by reducing law enforcement personnel increasing law enforcement accountability through,a shooting range in the classroom of the school Its my first time ever shooting a gun Its amazing for someone like me living in this suburb for the first time said Michael Taylor his son who lives just down the street An ARstyle rifle was used in an attack in the school to kill three teachers when three of them were teaching students the shooting from a distance Police have not identified who was behind the shooting,0

Entrepreneur behind fight for sharing D printed gun blueprints on why hes advocating for the peoples right to keep and bear arms A judge temporarily stopped Cody Wilson from posting D gun blueprints online Why man says hes fighting to be allowed to post blueprints for D printed guns Why man says hes fighting to be allowed to post blueprints for D printed guns ABC News Cody Wilson has been called one of the most dangerous people on the Internet For years Wilson has fought to make sure anyone should be able to download the files to make a gun at home with the click of a button using a D printer or a computer automated milling machine Ive demonstrated especially these last few weeks that the idea of gun control in the internet age is inoperable Wilson told ABC News Nightline Last week a federal judge temporarily stopped him from putting gun blueprints online the latest chapter in an ongoing battle with the federal government states the District of Columbia and gun control advocates If Cody Wilson is not stopped then what we will find is a universe where the internet has plans to D print any kind of weapon anybody wants with printers that make that incredibly easy for someone to do in only a few hours in their garage or in their living room Avery Gardiner copresident of the Brady Campaign told Nightline Cody Wilson owner of Defense Distributed company holds a D printed gun called the Liberator in his factory in Austin Texas Aug Kelly WestAFPGetty Images Wilson invited Nightline to Austin Texas which is the home of his company Defense Distributed The yearold said he originally wanted to be a lawyer I had a better idea Wilson said His idea was Could you make WikiLeaks for guns In he and his friends were some of the first people to D print a plastic gun which they called The Liberator They shared the blueprint file on the internet where Wilson says it was downloaded more than times in just the first week Thats when the federal government jumped The State Department argued that by posting the blueprints Wilson was basically doing the same thing as exporting weapons abroad Wilson took down the blueprints and in filed a lawsuit against the State Department arguing that the digital gun blueprints are a form of free speech Wilson says its both a First Amendment issue and a Second Amendment issue Its both but the way that this had to be fought for years in court was on a First Amendment claim Wilson said A D printed gun called the Liberator is seen in a factory in Austin Texas Aug Kelly WestAFPGetty Images Andy Greenberg a senior writer at WIRED has covered Wilson and the digital DIY gun debate since If a gun is a piece of data then are you allowed to share it and call it free speech That is the argument that Defense Distributed has been making for the last three years Greenberg told Nightline All the headlines are always about D printed guns But for Defense Distributed D printing is almost just like a standin for this idea of any kind of digital tool that allows you to with just a download and a click create a gun component at home said Greenberg In a surprise turn this summer the Trump administration reached a settlement with Wilson and Defense Distributed that would have allowed him to publish his gun blueprints online He started publishing some of the files on July but was forced again to remove them when a judge issued a temporary restraining order last week Wilson says that his aim is less about making weapons but instead giving people the tools to make a gun Posting guns to the internet my goodness in these terms knowing the attorneys general will sue nothing beats it Wilson said At his companys Texas headquarters Wilson showed how his company has moved beyond the D printing of plastic guns into making metal guns using a computerautomated milling machine Wilson has developed a computerautomated milling machine which is small enough to sit on a desk and it costs just It carves metal parts into the main component of different firearms like the AR and glock This will take you a couple of hours and it doesnt require your constant intercession Wilson explained while the machine milled part of an AR Its perfectly legal Instead of publishing the computer data needed to operate the milling machine Wilson ships it to his customers Unlike the plastic versions that sometimes malfunctioned experts say the metal versions can be similar to what you buy at a gun store Greenberg said the milling machine is the most practical technology right now for homemade guns that circumvent all gun control laws and present a much more practical threat than D printing Weapons like these have been called ghost guns as they have no serial number can be assembled at home and are virtually untraceable The term ghost gun refers to guns that really appear out of nowhere Gardiner said We dont have any register of who bought them how they were sold JC Cotter installs an electronic package for a Ghost Gunner milling machine at the Defense Distributed factory in Austin Texas Aug Kelly WestAFPGetty Images But homemade guns are not new and in many cases perfectly legal But critics say Wilsons machine could make it easier for these firearms to get into the hands of people who arent legally allowed to own guns like felons or the mentally ill We have seen ghost guns used in shootings around America in the last several years said Gardiner Leticia Franco still remembers the day five years ago when a gunman opened fire in Santa Monica killing four five people including Francos father and sister You feel so sad like a part of you is taken away Franco told Nightline The shooter had used a ghost gun An investigation revealed that he had a history of mental health issues and previously had tried to buy a gun but was denied The shooter instead ordered parts online and assembled them into a gun himself This incident was not at all connected to Wilson but Franco says shes afraid of what Wilsons doing Providing this information is wrong Hes also ethically responsible for what other people do with this information Franco said You provided these people with information that could potentially cause another tragedy Wilson says he is aware of the potential dangers of making access to ghost guns easier This isnt just like playing games on your keyboard right on the internet Ive had customers arrested right in other states for owning guns when they shouldnt have Wilson said But again Im advocating that these are the necessary consequences of ensuring the peoples right to keep and bear arms Wilson continued I reserve the right to change my mind about it right Maybe somehow it would deeply affect me and I would choose to discontinue the operation I dont know Im a full human being For now Wilson is stuck waiting to find out if the courts will allow him to upload those gun blueprints despite the fact that other websites already have posted the exact files that Defense Distributed was hosting on its own site according to Greenberg The government has essentially failed even though they tried this legal approach they have failed to censor this information Its getting out there Greenberg explained In the meantime Wilson is continuing business shipping out those milling machines of which he said hes sold a thousand so far this year Despite all the legal battles ahead Wilson says he refuses to back down A gun is power and this is the essence of this project Im actually giving people the means to create a power for themselves and Im zealous to do that Thats real for me he said People can misuse it but its power all the same Its a conversation beyond good and evil,entrepreneur behind fight for sharing d printed gun blueprints on why hes advocating for the peoples right to keep and bear arms Rigged by government controlmongering pushing the borders of the US and Canada on gun sales at all costs and a government controlled media circus that paints the whole war on gun freedoms as a massive fraud by the government responsible guns are now almost impossible to obtain in the US and other foreignoccupied territories,cody wilson the founder of defense districting at his factory in austin tex You look at their backs and they had the same eyes the same lips the same teeth they looked like they was going to kill each other The people around them were not so sure if this was the truth Their eyes were still open What were they going to do Shepherds and sheep would not be able to run away,1

defensive by angry students teachers and parents who are demanding stronger guncontrol measures after the shooting rampage that claimed several lives at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School The latest mass shooting at the Florida high school has some pondering the improbable Could this one actually bring some measure of change Michael LaughlinSouth Florida SunSentinel via AP File PARKLAND Fla AP The progression has become numbingly repetitive mass bloodshed unleashed by a gunman followed by the stories of the fallen the funerals the mourning the talking heads and the calls for change that dwindle into nothingness The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School though has some pondering the improbable Could this latest carnage actually lead to gun reforms Alongside the familiar refrains stemming from earlier shootings the Feb attack in Parkland Florida came with something else young survivors immediately pleading for nationwide action They have led walkouts confronted politicians and garnered the support of celebrities linking their sorrowful eloquent outraged voices to the gun debate Our kids have started a revolution Stoneman Douglas teacher Diane Wolk Rogers said during a CNNsponsored forum Wednesday In the aftermath of the violence that claimed lives students have piled into buses and crashed a meeting of lawmakers in Tallahassee Theyve relentlessly badgered Florida Sen Marco Rubio about his support from the National Rifle Association Theyve rejected President Trumps condolences calling for action over words To many advocates for gun control the moment feels more profound than any since the aftermath of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Connecticut where firstgraders and six adults were fatally shot spurring the most serious congressional gun debate in years The mantra just became if we couldnt do it after Newtown if we couldnt do it after however many yearolds were killed its never going to happen said Dave Cullen the author of Columbine which chronicles the shooting at the Colorado high school of the same name Then this happened Cullen said and everything changed Parkland is a welltodo suburb with a median household income more than twice the national average Stoneman Douglas is a toptier public school under the state rating system where most students take advancedplacement classes and the curriculum includes yoga and culinary arts Charles Zelden a professor of history and political science at Nova Southeastern University in nearby Fort Lauderdale said the students speaking out in the shootings aftermath come from a tradition of being heard and are angry enough right now that they wont stand for not being heard Theyre used to the idea that theyre going to make a difference that people are going to listen to them Zelden said Cullen wonders whether the Parkland attack indicates that its not the number of deaths or level of outrage that a shooting evokes but whether its the right group of people with the right standing and the right set of abilities that picks up the ball and runs with it Hes been awed that the tragedy produced not just one wellspoken young student activist but a deep bench of them Emma Gonzalez stirred a huge crowd with shouts of Shame on you directed at lawmakers David Hogg has emerged as a media star giving poised interview after interview Sarah Chadwick whose angry tweet to Trump went viral stirred those gathered in the state Capitol rotunda with what she promised was a revolution on behalf of fallen friends Never again should a child be afraid to go to school she said Never again should students have to protest for their lives Andy Pelosi a cochair of the Florida Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence has spent the past two decades fighting for gun control and watching in despair as a stream of tragedies seemed to bring little meaningful change He likewise was struck by students collective response Id like to think this is different Pelosi said noting that the students impassioned actions are helping galvanize a movement even if they face formidable odds And if you look at our history the main social movements in our country have been fueled by students Pelosi said In matching a donation by George and Amal Clooney to the students planned marches against gun violence Oprah Winfrey compared the teens to the Freedom Riders of the s who rode buses into southern states in protest of racial segregation and others shared that sentiment Jacob UdoUdo Jacob a professor at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania who studies social mediafueled activism said the students have a chance to stir something equally profound Jacob cited Rosa Parks arrest in the fight for civil rights and street vendor Mohamed Bouazizis selfimmolation in Tunisia which led to the Arab Spring Any movement historically its down to narratives how the movement is framed Jacob said The teens dont agree on all issues but most want ARs banned and the age for buying rifles in Florida raised to as it is for handguns Many want all semiautomatic rifles banned Uniformly they want stronger background checks so people like the yearold shooter who was known to be mentally unstable and violent cannot buy guns Their message seems to already be having at least some effect with Trump Rubio and Gov Rick Scott all taking some steps toward greater gun regulation Rubio said his visit to Stoneman Douglas is what prompted him to change his stance on largecapacity magazines Alongside the reasons for hope though have been signs of the tough road ahead Some conservatives have portrayed the teens as pawns being exploited to take away constitutional rights with the NRA insisting that liberals want to ban all guns Farright voices have even sought to advance the lie that some of the students are crisis actors essentially paid puppets helping advance an antigun agenda Everything theyre doing is right out of the Democrat Partys various playbooks Rush Limbaugh said of the students on his show Monday To Dr Allen Konis whose son is a freshman at Stoneman Douglas the students are so inspiring that even their enemies are taking notice They are worried and they should be Konis said because they are going to start a real movement in this country After watching Virginia Tech and Orlando and Las Vegas and so many other places become mile markers in the thwarted march to pass significant federal gun laws the voices of Parklands teens are bringing hope to advocates craving change Nobodys going to stop these kids said Mike McFadden a yearold retired police officer who drove several hours from his home in Indialantic to visit Stoneman Douglas where a makeshift memorial of white crosses is surrounded by mounds of flowers Alissa Parker who cofounded Safe and Sound Schools after her daughter Emilie was killed at Sandy Hook said the Stoneman Douglas students simply want to feel safe It makes her remember how Emilie would run to

Some critics believe violent video games might be influencing the behavior of young people AFP PhotoTHOMAS SAMSON San Francisco AFP Video game industry representatives will trek to Washington Thursday to persuade lawmakers that virtual violence does not trigger realworld lashing out amid a reignited gun debate in the wake of the latest horrific school shooting The meeting between US President Donald Trump and the Entertainment Software Association ESA trade group comes less than a month after a teenaged gunman bearing a semiautomatic weapon shot dead people at his former Florida high school In the aftermath of the attack Trump pointed to video games as a possible contributing factor to the firearms violence plaguing the nation We have to look at the internet because a lot of bad things are happening to young kids and young minds and their minds are being formed the Republican leader said And also video games Im hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young peoples thoughts But the ESA says gaming is plainly not at fault wielding data showing no established link between games and violence in the flesh Like all Americans we are deeply concerned about the level of gun violence in the United States the ESA said in response to an AFP inquiry about the upcoming White House meeting Video games are plainly not the issue entertainment is distributed and consumed globally but the US has an exponentially higher level of gun violence than any other nation Video games are calculated to be a billion a year global business by market intelligence firm NewZoo White House rematch Thursdays meeting comes five years after Joe Biden then vice president met with the ESA heads of major video game companies and researchers as the nation grappled with Connecticuts Sandy Hook massacre that saw primary schoolage children gunned down Following that shooting the National Rifle Association singled out video games as the true danger to society There exists in this country a callous corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells and sows violence against its own people said the NRAs Wayne LaPierre blaming vicious violent video games as well as bloodsoaked films But gaming industry veteran Mark DeLoura who attended the Biden meeting and later spent two years as a White House senior adviser for digital media said that if anything it seems like it has gotten clearer there is no correlation All of our research related to games is there Trump would just have to ask for it he said That makes me mad one administration should learn from another Both the American Psychological Association APA and the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP have taken a stance in recent years against children and teens playing violent video games But a rising number of academics question the evidence of a link between gaming and aggression and more than scholars joined to speak out against an APA report affirming such a connection Gutfeelings vs facts It is not the first time video games have come under scrutiny a highprofile congressional hearing spearheaded by Democratic senators targeted games including Mortal Kombat and Night Trap for violent play with some lawmakers saying the games encouraged or desensitized minors to brutality and bloodshed A later effort by California officials to ban sales of violent video games to children was struck down by the US Supreme Court in on the grounds that like books and films games are protected by constitutional rights to free speech DeLoura said blaming video games that feature brutal play might stem from the gutfeelings of adults watching children engage in virtual battles rather than hard data Whats causing shootings is guns are so accessible that when you have an impulse you can act on it he said Does it have to be more complicated than that With a gun culture that runs deep America is deadlocked over how to stem the scourge of mass shootings But video games the industry holds are innocent Blaming video games for violence in the real world is no more productive than blaming the news media for bringing violent crimes into our homes night after night the ESA says on its website Video game play is booming as spectator sport with fans flocking to arenas for tournaments as well as watching matches online The association notably cites data trends showing that violent crime particularly by young people has declined in the US since the early s even as video games have flourished The rise of this conversation again isnt about facts it isnt about research said DeLoura in a recent blog post Its about politics,white house weighs video game link to gun violence in Ohio he claims to have pulled gun from his car But his claim to have pulled the trigger did not match up with his claim that he shot the gun which is the gun used in Michael Browns shooting by cops I did not The police officer was lying to me My blood was on the ground Ferguson told MSNBC in

A campaign by New York Democratic Gov Andrew Cuomo to crack down on the National Rifle Association and similar groups is facing its first big legal test with a federal judge expected to decide soon whether to allow a challenge to go forward Cuomos administration has asked Judge Thomas McAvoy of the US Northern District of New York to throw out a First Amendment lawsuit by the NRA that claims the policy restricting financial activity with progun organizations amounts to viewpoint discrimination The judge heard arguments on the motion to dismiss on Sept The decision whatever it may be will have farreaching ramifications for freespeech and gun rights the limits of financial regulation and possibly even the presidential contest The case has prompted an unusual alliance The liberal American Civil Liberties Union despite its support for gun control filed a friend of the court brief in defense of the freespeech rights of the NRA Earlier this month Cuomo defeated actress Cynthia Nixon in the Democratic gubernatorial primary and he will likely coast to reelection to a third term in November Though he said he wont run for president hes widely seen as a potential contender for the Democratic nomination and going after one of the lefts most reviled organizations could only help in that pursuit The case is more important than anyones political aspirations said William Brewer the lawyer for the NRA in the case This is giving the power to a state to discriminate against entities based on viewpoint Brewer told Fox News If the script was flipped and a conservative governor of Kansas was very prolife his administration could target Planned Parenthoods financial activity Brewer added Or if its another governor the administration could target the finances of Friends of the Earth or the Sierra Club In April Cuomo directed the states Department of Financial Services to encourage insurance companies banks and other financial services companies licensed in New York state to review whether business interactions with the NRA and other similar organizations would pose reputational risk New York may have the strongest gun laws in the country but we must push further to ensure that gun safety is a top priority for every individual company and organization that does business across the state Cuomo said at the time New York Financial Services Superintendent Maria T Vullo said the agency urges all insurance companies and banks doing business in New York to join the companies that have already discontinued their arrangements with the NRA In May the department hit Lockton Affinity with a million fine and Chub Ltd with a million fine for their involvement with the NRAs Carry Guard insurance for gun owners that use a firearm in selfdefense but face civil or criminal liability expenses Both companies dropped the NRA The Second Amendment group now contends it has trouble getting corporate insurance because companies fear state investigation while banks have declined to provide financial services for the organization Cuomo also urged fellow governors in an August letter to ban Carry Guard because the NRAs insurance policy is providing illegal insurance coverage to gun owners for intentional criminal conduct In the motion to dismiss New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood argued Both the guidance letters and the press releases are classic government speechthey are expressing the governments position in the public gun control debate which is entirely permissible However Cuomo may have undermined Underwoods argument when he gleefully tweeted in August If the goes bankrupt because of the State of New York theyll be in my thoughts and prayers Ill see you in court New York has definitely used state power going well beyond expressing an opinion Brewer argues The state took actions well beyond the guidance letters Brewer told Fox News The dots connect themselves The governor sent out a press advisory that Superintendent Vullo is monitoring not just the NRA but other proSecond Amendment groups Shortly after within days the department issued fines The New York Department of Financial Services referred Fox News to the April announcement on the policy and when asked if someone could speak on the policy a spokesperson said unfortunately no not at this time Neither Cuomos office nor Underwoods office responded to inquiries for this report The program is similar in spirit to the Obama administrations Operation Choke Point which tried to discourage banks from offering financial services to high risk customers which included shortterm lenders and firearms dealers The Trump Justice Department later ended the program The liberal ACLU and the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation each filed a friend of the court brief in the New York case siding with the NRAs ability to move for discovery The ACLU brief in August said New York indisputably targeted the NRA and similar groups based on their gun promotion advocacy It is important to note that however controversial it may be gun promotion is core political speech entitled to the same constitutional protection as speech advocating for reproductive rights marijuana legalization or financial deregulation the ACLU brief continued The central questions then are whether the guidance letters threatened adverse action against banks and insurers that associate with the NRA or other gun promotion advocacy groups and whether this threat was motivated by the governments hostility to a gun promotion viewpoint Fred Lucas is the White House correspondent for the Daily Signal Follow him ,andrew cuomo using banks to target nra faces major legal test following comments by US judge RICHMOND COUNTY Wash Aug The Rutherford County Clerks

The most important rule of camp use your words Dear Jake I am writing this even though you might never read this Not just because you are four years old and cant read but because there is minuscule but very real chance that youll never get to I realized this as a fouryearold aimed a gun at my forehead You see we are living in a very unpredictable world I know its scary to think about but sometimes people do bad bad things and people even little kids like you especially little kids like you can get hurt Okay granted the gun wasnt real and though Im sure the child was also aware of this fact it was still jarring to watch one of my adorable Chipmunks lift a giant tree branch off the ground cock it against a pudgy shoulder and level it at me The other camp counselors froze Hey Jake what are you doing I tried to ask lightheartedly as I approached him Jake in all his delightful toddler glory shrieked happily and darted behind a bush Without much probing I soon learned that Jake under the influence of sixyearold camper Timmy had been reenacting a scene out of the video game Fortnite Timmy had played I know you think we usually have all the answers Jake but I dont have an answer to give you as to why this stuff happens After playfully chiding Timmy for playing video games that werent appropriate I tried to redirect the childrens interest in guns So what do your guns shoot Bullets Bullets Why thats lame I cried in an exaggerated manner I then grasped my head as I pretended to have a stroke of genius Oh my gosh You know what would be better The kids leaned in What if the guns shot out food What if you were shooting chocolate chips or burgers or For the remainder of the day I found myself being sniped by imaginary fries and marshmallows The truth is life isnt always fun and games But you should never let that stop you from enjoying your childhood Jake You should never let the fear of getting hurt or failing or dying stop you from living Nowhere written in my camp booklet does it tell you how to talk to campers about current events and serious topics like gun violence Jake did not consciously raise the issue but after his little stunt in the park the topic of gun safety was on the minds of all the counselors As we struggled to find a way to communicate our discomfort with the shooting game we found ourselves more and more on edge with each pew pew we heard from the boys And for good reason Soon all the other preschoolers were playing their own games of Fortnite Every stray object became a gun the building tower blocks the Legos the tree branches and twigs Little boys and girls alike were chasing one another or makebelieve assailants throughout the classrooms and outdoor courts as they triumphantly brandished their weapons The truth is there is nothing technically wrong with a fouryearold pretending to play with a gun But there is something deeply unsettling about it Though bestowed as a right in our constitution our ability to wield guns is something I have always struggled with accepting I dont like the idea of making people feel unsafe because they feel that their freedoms are being compromised but I also dont like the idea of making people feel unsafe because they feel that their lives are being compromised In fact assaults by firearms kill about people or one out of people in the US each year according to Business Insider The chance of dying in such a manner is more than times as high as dying from any force of nature and about percent more likely than the lifetime risk of dying while riding inside a vehicle But you have to be careful Jake And you have to understand that sometimes things that appear fun and silly are not really that way at all You have to be considerate of that Jake But I know you will be right I am fortunate to say I have never been directly affected by the consequences of the Second Amendment My parents are immigrants and for one reason or another I failed to inherit the reverence for guns that many of my fellow peers and Americans have developed I was raised in a home where my only contact with guns were through the veil of a TV screen When your family members have lived through an uprising and bloody war it is not unimaginable that they would seek to put as many barriers between their loved ones and any tools of violence And that is what guns have always been to me Tools Weapons Used to protect but more often than not to hurt Besides the occasional flash I would catch from my screen or black and white headline I didnt encounter stories about guns too much Until I found myself writing an article about a former professional football player and alumnus whose shooting threat put my school on lockdown last February Until I found protesting in front of the White House as millions of students around the country walked out of their classrooms declaring enough is enough Until I found myself staying up all night to research statistics about gun shootings and gun violence the numbers still branded into my brain long after I slammed my computer shut in frustration and despair You were born in Jake I was in seventh or eighth grade at the time Happy and Uptown Funk were the hit songs on the radio and Frozen was having its moment Germany won the World Cup and the whole Sochi Winter Olympics doping scandal went down but no one would know about that right away It seems so long ago In incidents involving a gun occurred according to Vox people were wounded people died It seems like yesterday Im a camp counselor My biggest concerns usually are along the lines of making sure no one forgets their shoes and identifying the weird puddle in the corner as hopefully water Quite simply Im expected to keep the campers relatively content and alive And though I am incredibly fortunate to say I have no reason to believe my campers will ever be unsafe and that we will all indeed remain alive that is not a guarantee anymore for others elsewhere in the nation Because thats the world we live in today A world where these children could find themselves targets of something they used to joke about at camp Suddenly a fouryearolds fascination with guns and violent video games doesnt seem so funny and lighthearted anymore But heres one thing that will never change your ability to make change Human beings are far more powerful than we think And yes sometimes that is a bad thing but its also a wonderful thing as well We are incredibly adept at using tools and creating new ones It is how we use these tools that will determine who we are and what the world will become We can never let ourselves feel removed from the issue of gun safety We can never let ourselves become desensitized Not here Not now Not ever again I remember you were asking me how to spell a word the other day You were asking me to teach you how to write Do not ever forget that guns are not the only tools human have to use But I remain optimistic Having faith in the future could after all be considered synonymous with believing in the next generation Because I know that even though this article will probably not cause any great change other words might Words that will strengthen gun regulations and increase safety in our neighborhoods and defend our ability to wield the greatest tool of them all our words Dont ever forget that Jake And though I have no doubt youd be a fearsome warrior nurture your curiosity and fascination with writing You are already have a formidable connection with words After all look at what you inspired me to write Until next summer Saba Fictional names were used because even though they cant or wont read this my campers and their identities should always stay safe and protected,an open letter to my camper the pen is mightier than the gun hs insiders report at the top a second and not so much the pen itself There are some good reports to be done here I dont blame the magazine as the mag used to act as the frontend but I wonder if the mag is less likely to have been purchased or stored for use in a combat situation This is another thing ,a copy of the fortnite timmy played a scene out of the video game fortnite This site will be updated as more videos come out Its a joke Please send us some videos bFdFfDqXZjh,0

Jeff Dysinger and his daughter Hannah pose for a portrait in their Kentucky home Jeff Dysinger and his daughter Hannah pose for a portrait in their Kentucky home Brandon Dill For The Washington Post John Woodrow Cox and Steven Rich The Washington Post The gunfire had lasted less than seconds but now hidden behind locked doors all across the rural campus teenagers wept and bled and prayed Police would soon swarm Marshall County Highs hallways on that chilly morning in January and though the exact number of students who had been shot remained unknown for hours it didnt take investigators long to find the boy they believed had pulled the trigger His name was Gabriel Parker a sophomore whose family lived near the banks of Kentucky Lake Before word spread that two were dead and were wounded a detective headed south in search of the answer to a question Where had Parker who was gotten the gun Beneath a wind chime topped with a metal cross Parkers stepfather Justin Minyard opened the front door of their modest frame house and the detective told him what had just happened The yearolds stepson police alleged had opened fire on hundreds of students gathered in Marshalls commons with a Ruger mm semiautomatic pistol Minyard according to court records acknowledged that he kept one firearm in the home stored in his bedroom closet He walked back and checked the shelf His gun Minyard told the detective was gone In the hours that followed police say Parker confessed to his interrogators that getting the weapon was easy It hadnt been secured with a lock or sealed in a safe or even hidden somewhere secret The night before the shooting Parker explained he carried a laundry basket to his parents bedroom closet He reached up to a shelf and grabbed the pistol which was inside a case then stuffed it beneath the clothes Parker also took at least two magazines along with the bullets he needed leaving behind more than rounds of ammunition that police would later seize The next morning he put the handgun in his bag and rode with his mom to the school of students where at am police said he fired the first round Since the shooters in at least acts of gun violence at primary and secondary schools have been under the age of according to an analysis by The Washington Post Discussions about how to curb shootings at American schools have centered on arming teachers or improving mental health treatment banning militarystyle rifles or strengthening background checks But if kids as young as did not have access to guns The Posts findings show twothirds of school shootings over the past two decades could not have happened While investigators dont always determine or publicly reveal the weapons origins The Post found cases in which the source was identified Of those the guns were taken from a childs home or those of relatives or friends times The Post discovered just four instances when the adult owners of the weapons were criminally punished because they failed to lock them up When Commonwealth Attorney Mark Blankenship took on the Parker prosecution his focus was solely on ensuring that the teen would be tried as an adult making him eligible to receive a life sentence But the longer Blankenship thought about how Parker had gotten the weapon the more it troubled him Parker wasnt a hunter and didnt hang out much with the high schoolers who were The teen a plump redhead who wore glasses was quiet and shy He had a small group of friends mostly from Marshalls marching band in which he played the tuba The teen couldnt have persuaded another student or anyone else to give him a weapon without raising considerable suspicion Blankenship concluded To the prosecutor that meant the only gun Parker could have used to ravage his high school was the one he took from his stepfathers closet Like almost everyone he knows Blankenship owns a firearm Its a shotgun his father passed down to him and though he doesnt keep shells for it and has never considered himself an enthusiast hes been around guns since birth Blankenship also appreciates why someone would want to reach a weapon quickly during a breakin so he researched gun safes online and what he found were more than a dozen devices for under that had been designed to securely store pistols just like Minyards and be opened in less than three seconds Thats when it really hit me Blankenship said that this was so easily preventable Gun rights are revered in Marshall County a community of where in voters backed Donald Trump in Generations of cattle corn and tobacco farmers throughout this nearly allwhite swath of countryside have long viewed their rifles and shotguns much the same way they do their rakes and shovels essential tools that on their own could do no harm In fact many people still find it more unseemly to drink a beer in public Marshall was dry until than to wield an AR rifle in public legal in almost all of Kentucky thanks to its opencarry law Brandon Dill For The Washington Post Signs reading Marshall Strong line the roadside in Benton Ky In January nearby Marshall County High School was the site of a deadly school shooting Signs reading Marshall Strong line the roadside in Benton Ky In January nearby Marshall County High School was the site of a deadly school shooting Brandon Dill For The Washington Post Blankenship in office since was on the verge of beginning his reelection campaign and knew that scrutinizing the pistols owner would be unpopular but he just couldnt shake how much trauma one gun in the hand of one yearold had caused There were the teachers whod been covered in their own students blood the officers whose kids were begging them not to go back to work the paramedic who could no longer stand large crowds the young siblings of high schoolers who imagined they would be shot next the two couples who had outlived their children and the teenagers so many that Blankenship couldnt fit everyones parents into his office who had bullet holes in their arms and legs and chests and stomachs and faces So about a week after the shooting in a meeting with investigators the prosecutor finally said it out loud Im seriously thinking about going after the stepfather Every year state lawmakers across the country propose bills to hold adults criminally liable for negligently storing guns where children can reach them and every year for various reasons legislatures decide not to pass those bills Only states and the District of Columbia have approved such laws according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence but even those statutes researchers say are often not enforced are too limited or carry weak penalties rendering them ineffective The issue drew national attention in May after a yearold in Santa Fe Texas was accused of killing people at his school with a handgun and a shotgun that belonged to his dad Although the state has a negligentstorage law the father could not be charged under it because Texas defines a child as or younger Brandon Dill For The Washington Post Commonwealth Attorney Mark Blankenship stands in the circuit courtroom in the Calloway County Judicial Building in Murray Ky He is is prosecuting former Marshall County High School student Gabriel Parker who is accused of killing two students and wounding others in a mass shooting on January Commonwealth Attorney Mark Blankenship stands in the circuit courtroom in the Calloway County Judicial Building in Murray Ky He is is prosecuting former Marshall County High School student Gabriel Parker who is accused of killing two students and wounding others in a mass shooting on January Brandon Dill For The Washington Post Russ Hauge didnt think he needed a special law when the former Washington state prosecutor took on what he called a case of gross gross negligence in A thirdgrader he said had found a caliber semiautomatic handgun in the home of his mothers boyfriend Douglas Bauer who kept firearms loaded unlocked and in some cases cocked throughout the place The boy then put the weapon in his backpack and took it to school where it accidentally fired leaving a bullet lodged near the spine of an yearold girl The prosecutor knew he could charge Bauer with reckless endangerment he said but a misdemeanor wouldnt strip the man of his right to own a gun so Hauge charged him with thirddegree assault a felony Hauge believed Bauers actions perfectly fit the definition of criminal negligence that causes bodily harm to another person by means of a weapon The state Supreme Court however disagreed deciding the law was too vague to sustain the charge Hauge who left office in said he owns several firearms and is a firm supporter of the Second Amendment but he just as strongly believes that every state in America should require gun owners to secure their weapons Instead thousands of children have used unlocked pistols shotguns and rifles to kill themselves or accidentally shoot others And theyve wielded them again and again to target classmates In a yearold boy in Florida found what he thought was a cookie tin in his grandfathers bedroom that instead held a caliber handgun and several rounds of ammunition The teen loaded the weapon and killed a teacher at school The grandfather was never charged Brandon Dill For The Washington Post Gabriel Parker allegedly took the gun from this home in Hardin Ky where

yearold boy in Minnesota opened a dresser drawer in which his father stored nearly a dozen guns and picked out a caliber pistol that hed fired before at a shooting range He used it to kill two classmates at school The father a sheriffs deputy was never charged Both states had already passed laws that require adults to keep their guns away from kids but each statute includes significant caveats that limit prosecutors ability to use it In fact none of the four successful prosecutions identified by The Post resulted from charges related to negligentstorage laws The harshest penalty among those cases was a month term behind bars for involuntary manslaughter In that instance a man in Michigan had used a shoe box to store his caliber semiautomatic handgun which a yearold visitor found and took to school then fatally shot a firstgrade classmate To effect real change Hauge argues adults must face felonies Were looking at a class of crimes where deterrence might actually work he said If there was a clear law that says felony punishment will ensue if you dont handle your weapons safely I think we could get some peoples attention In western Kentucky Missy Jenkins Smith has been trying to get peoples attention for two decades On the morning of Dec Jenkins Smith had just finished a prayer circle at Heath High miles northwest of Marshall when she watched a schoolmate get shot in the head A moment later a round struck her in the chest In all three people died and five were wounded At the age of Jenkins Smith was paralyzed from the chest down She later learned that the shooter then had stolen the caliber semiautomatic pistol from the garage of a neighbor whod left the gun outside his safe Brandon Dill For The Washington Post A dog sits in front of the home of

has no issue with guns her husband a hunter owns several But when she heard how authorities say Parker had gotten his weapon she realized how little had changed in Kentucky over the past years The owner of the pistol that left her in a wheelchair was never charged Instead police said he got his gun back Hannah Dysinger was already waiting for her best friend when the girl arrived at Marshall High on the morning of Jan You look so cute Hannah told Bailey Holt who was wearing jeans trendy darkrimmed glasses and as she did almost every day a pair of Converse sneakers Hannah and Bailey both occupied their usual spot near one entrance in Marshalls commons a wide open room with a twostoryhigh ceiling where hundreds of teens gathered each day before classes Hannah liked the way her makeup looked so she insisted Bailey take a photo with her new iPhone X Hannah grinned for the camera revealing her braces as she held up a McDonalds frappe It was spirit week at Marshall and each day had a certain theme so as the commons swelled before first period many students were sporting red white and blue for that Tuesdays motif America Then came the first gunshot Hannah looked into Baileys eyes for what felt like a long time but wasnt because then Hannah heard another shot and another and another She turned and ran for the door fleeing across the parking lot toward the schools football field as dozens of other panicked students stampeded alongside her Hannahs phone rang It was her boyfriend whod been with them inside Where are you she asked and as he told her he was safe Hannah felt something warm and wet inside her black Timberland shirt She looked down then she saw it There was a bullet hole in her chest Im bleeding she shrieked Im bleeding The commons had gone quiet by the

The American Civil Liberties Union is defending the National Rifle Association against attempts by New York state leaders to put it out of business Reasoncom reported New Yorks attempts to compel banks and insurance companies to remove the NRA as a customer is a violation of the First Amendment the ACLU argued in brief filed in federal court on Friday The brief supports a lawsuit previously filed by the NRA Although public officials are free to express their opinions and may condemn viewpoints or groups they view as inimical to public welfare they cannot abuse their regulatory authority to retaliate against disfavored advocacy organizations and to impose burdens on those organizations ability to conduct lawful business according to the ACLU The ACLU brief does not defend the NRAs stance on firearms but instead uses a long list of First Amendment cases to argue that regulators should not use their positions to punish political enemies according to the report An intimidation campaign against the NRA reportedly began last fall a timeline prepared by the group suggests It started when an antigun group Everytown for Gun Safety met with New York leaders in September according to the report A month later a Department of Financial Services investigation led to a company called Lockton ditching the NRA as a customer in February The same happened with Chubb and Lloyds What did the state do Maria Vullo head of the states Department of Financial Services next sent letters letters to all banks financial institutions and insurers licensed to do business in New York In the letters he warned companies to stop doing business with proSecond Amendment groups that promote guns and lead to senseless violence Instead he urged the organizations to support the voices of the passionate courageous and articulate young people who want more firearms restrictions Vullo advised companies that received the letter to review any relationships they have with the NRA or similar gun promotion organizations and to take prompt actions to managing these risks and promote public health and safety New York Gov Andrew Cuomo supported the threat in a tweet the next day The NRA is an extremist organization I urge companies in New York State to revisit any ties they have to the NRA and consider their reputations and responsibility to the public Following the communications multiple banks withdrew bids to provide basic depository services for the NRA the report stated The NRA is also concerned about the fate of its TV channel with hosts including Dana Loesch and Cam Edwards unless it is able to obtain media liability insurance If Cuomo can do this to the NRA then conservative governors could have their financial regulators threaten banks and financial institutions that do business with any other group whose political views the governor opposes David Cole the ACLU legal director wrote in a blog post The First Amendment bars state officials from using their regulatory power to penalize groups merely because they promote disapproved ideas The ACLUs brief also noted that liberal groups can also be targeted based on their political views That approach has also been shot down on First Amendment grounds How has the state responded New York State maintains that the warnings from Cuomo and Vullo telling regulated businesses to stop doing business with the NRA and other proSecond Amendment groups are legal A brief filed August by New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood stated the letters do not constitute unconstitutional threats as a matter of law It also stated The Guidance Letters encouraged insurers and financial institutions to evaluate and manage risks that might arise from their dealings with gun promotion organizations in the face of the polarized political debate Both the Guidance Letters and the Press Releases are classic government speechthey are expressing the governments position in the public gun control debate which is entirely permissible Cuomo who faces a primary challenge next month from actress Cynthia Nixon had also posted a YouTube video titled Stand with us in the fight to end the NRAs stranglehold on American politics VOTE SEPT The NRA filed a supplemental brief today that stated The state could enact onerous building regulations then make it known that such regulations will be enforced only against landlords that rent space to the NAACP or Black Lives Matter Or the state could begin charging a sales tax for internet purchases but only enforce the tax against merchants who stock books by a

In the wake of several highprofile police shootings and as the momentum of the youthled gun control movement continues to carry forward the American public is taking a renewed interest in solutions to the wicked problems of public safety gun violence and police accountability Its become increasingly clear that we must work to address these problems in a way that acknowledges links between violence racism and public safety As my colleague and Institute for Policy Studies Associate Fellow Ebony SlaughterJohnson noted earlier this spring American police killed more people last year than mass shooters Where can we find holistic solutions ADVERTISEMENT In the runup to the March for Our Lives this March the students of Stoneman Douglas High School proposed a gun control policy manifesto published in The Guardian While its impressive in its scope especially as the product of a group of young people critics have made clear that some of the students suggested solutions would violate the privacy of the mentally ill and result in more aggressive policing More aggressive policing tactics cant be the answer of course We know that they disproportionately harm communities of color and ultimately lead to more violence The status quo of policing and mass incarceration have failed says Eugene Puryear of Stop Police Terror Project DC Study after study has shown us that mass incarceration and policing do not significantly reduce violence or other crime while carrying significant financial and social costs thats why a different approach is so important Treating gun violence as a public health crisis is the leading edge of this new approach and one that is gaining traction across the country including in the nations capital It could ultimately reduce Americas incarceration rate through rethinking our approach to crime prevention The Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results NEAR Act a law passed by the DC Council in modeled on this approach seeks to identify and address the root causes of crime while moving away from the failed status quo of policing and punishment that lead to increased arrests and incarceration as well as the harassment and targeting of communities of color while doing nothing to keep people safe ADVERTISEMENT Yet despite passing the DC Council unanimously in the NEAR Act is still awaiting full implementation by Mayor Muriel Bowsers administration There are three communitydriven prongs to violence prevention in the NEAR Act First the law requires Community Crime Prevention Teams of behavioral health professionals to work in communities to identify people with signs of mental illness or substance abuse and connect them with existing services outside of the criminal legal system Second the law requires a newlyestablished Office of Violence Prevention and Health Equity to prevent the viral spread of violence by bringing therapy and social service coordination directly to victims of interpersonal violence while theyre still in hospitals Third a newlyestablished Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement is tasked with identifying and directly engaging with individuals at high risk of committing or falling victim to violence and then providing individualized wraparound services to equip those individuals with the treatment training and support necessary to allow those at risk move towards a safer life Alongside these components the NEAR Act includes several elements to increase police accountability and recalibrate the strained relationship between neighborhood police and highlypoliced communities From expanding data collection and reporting requirements to prescribing training on bias and cultural competencies its a clear mandate for police to work to repair their ways of relating with areas that have suffered from harassment and police violence for years Heres the best part This broad communityled approach has been a success across America already In Richmond Calif where this approach was pioneered gun violence was reduced by over percent in just three years New York City piloted a similar model in five neighborhoods and the success led to its expansion into nearly neighborhoods After that expansion the city saw its lowest level of gun violence in three decades Other rigorous studies have proven that hospitalbased violence intervention programs like the one in the NEAR Act succeed at reducing gun violence This model is a replicable way to reduce gun violence It deserves to be taken seriously So whats the hold up in the District With this communitybased approach already bearing such fruit nationwide and holding such watershed potential for a different approach to public safety why is the nations capital holding back at implementing the NEAR Act Since the NEAR Act became law Mayor Bowser has consistently refused to fully or faithfully implement its lifesaving approaches says April Goggans of Black Lives Matter DC Wed like to see these policies implemented in substance to really transform whats happening in our communities and get the results we know are possible Unfortunately despite being law for over two years were still waiting for the NEAR Act to be implemented in substance The movement to combat gun violence in America is reaching a high watermark With luck wisdom and momentum one outcome could be a new approach to public safety that reduces violence without increasing Americas incarceration rate addresses root causes and empowers individuals and communities to thrive Justin Jacoby Smith is the digital communications strategist at the Institute for Policy Studies and a Washington DCbased activist,gun violence is a disease has dc found a cure Dr James J Jones of Childrens Hospital Chicago who was not involved in the study said the new study shows that children with mental illnesses who suffer from gun violence are more likely to be treated and cared for even if theyre no longer able to function on screen at home They have a longer life their mental health at risk is on the rise theyve had brain trauma or traumatic brain,a gun control demonstration in washington in april They have also put out a letter warning the protesters that police might break up protests if they start blocking vehicles and say the situation may escalate While that argument is mostly supported by protestors whats needed is an actual legal framework to justify their actions If youve ever been to the Mall on a Sunday night out in June you know that in New York City you wouldnt have witnessed a violent bloody mob as

Sundays shooting in Jacksonville served as a stark reminder that the issue of gun control wont go away in Florida politics AP Photo Florida mass shootings embolden Democrats on gun control MIAMI Another mass shooting in Florida reinjected the issue of firearms into state politics just two days before the gubernatorial primaries emboldening Democrats who have made an unprecedented gun control push since the Parkland shooting six months ago The Sunday shooting which came during a Madden NFL video game competition at a popular Jacksonville waterfront mall claimed the lives of three people including the shooter who committed suicide and left another wounded It was the sixth shooting involving more than four gunshot victims in Florida since the Pulse nightclub terrorist massacre that left dead and wounded in Advertisement It also served as a stark reminder that the issue of gun control wont go away in Florida politics in state and congressional races alike as highprofile shootings keep happening In a state where the National Rifle Association first won victories on stand your ground policies and concealed carry permits the shift in tone since the Feb Parkland massacre which left dead and wounded has been apparent It started with Gov Rick Scotts signing of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act Since then some Republicans have embraced gun control messaging in their campaigns And Democrats seem to have abandoned any fear of being branded as antigun For the first time ever all the major Democrats running for governor united around a gun control message with all five candidates calling for a ban on tactical assault rifles and all incorporating gun control in their paid media campaigns Two Democratic contenders for governor Jeff Greene and Philip Levine have featured Parkland survivors in paid TV ads and Greene tussled with NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer after he sent out a mailer depicting kids in school hallways with rifle sites drawn over their heads Obviously what just happened in Jacksonville reintroduced the issue into the narrative says former GOP Rep David Jolly who is now a political commentator Weve already seen the change even with Republicans this year was the first time in generations we saw Republicans pass more gun control and not less Sadly weve come to anticipate that another mass shooting before November is somewhere within the realm of the plausible he added In all at least television ads from Democratic candidates and a gun control group Giffords have aired in Florida Never has the state seen so many Democrats on offense over the issue and so many Republicans grappling with the issue To understand the shift just look at Rod Smith a rural North Florida Democrat who ran for governor in and was the partys lieutenant governor candidate Smith helped push stand your ground through the Florida Legislature persuaded all of his former state Senate Democratic colleagues to back the policy and always ran for office on the belief that gun control hurts Democrats Gun voters vote guns he once believed whereas gun control voters arent singleissue voters But no more he says Times have changed Smith said Theres still a strong progun constituency that tends to be single issue But with the rise of Millennials and the increase of urban residency in our state theres a rising constituency of people who want rational gun laws The tragedies of the last decade of more recent times cant be ignored Almost as soon as news of Sundays slaughter hit Democrats reiterated calls for more gun control The two major Republican gubernatorial candidates Rep Ron DeSantis and Adam Putnam avoided the topic as did Scott who signed the gun control legislation this year but had previously been a reliable NRA supporter DeSantis and Putnam canceled campaign stops in Jacksonville I am tired of hearing When is enough going to be enough I am tired of hearing thoughts and prayers from those who do nothing said Gwen Graham one of the top Democratic candidates for Florida governor We need to end these mass shootings and the only way to do that is to vote out the politicians complicit in this cycle of death Grahams comments echoed the other Democrats for governor But Sen Bill Nelson who has also embraced an assault weapons ban held off on more political statements Sunday Nelson is being challenged this year by Scott who used his Twitter feed to announce he was offering state aid and that he had spoken with the Jacksonville mayor President Donald Trump and state and local law enforcement officials Heading to Jacksonville now to meet with local law enforcement State law enforcement is currently providing assistance Scott announced Sunday evening on Twitter Within moments one of the top Parkland high school gun control advocates David Hogg replied on Twitter by asking Scott to reject any NRA political support Will you take the pledge Scott who received NRA support in his reelection and signed every bill the organization wanted until this election season didnt answer Simmering in the background of Sundays mass shooting were two other highprofile shootings both at or near high school football games One of those shootings occurred nearby and just two days before in Jacksonville at a Raines High School game where one person was killed and two were injured The week before in South Florida at a Dwyer High School football game in Wellington two were shot After Sundays shooting Scott warned there were no easy answers and cautioned against making the case political The first thing people are going to go to is this political fight he said But lets look at this This young man and other young men theyre not valuing life Something is causing that As a society weve got to figure this out Every parent has got to say to themselves what can I do better Our church leaders have to say to themselves what can we be doing to get people more involved in faith Because when I was growing up this was not happening and its happening now NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said on Twitter that the incident was A horrible tragedy End gun free zones or have the security in place to keep people safe in them And other gunrights advocates noted that the accused shooter had driven to Florida from Baltimore in a state with strict gun laws and that the shooting therefore had little to do with Florida statute Florida has been a proving ground for the NRA the organization first succeeded in getting concealed weapons permits in Florida and then made it the home of its push for stand your ground selfdefense laws The state also occupied a major role in the Black Lives Matter debate after the killing of Trayvon Martin in in Sanford by a neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman who was found not guilty After the Zimmerman verdict Scott empaneled a committee to review the law but decided to make no changes Last year lawmakers made sure to give stand your ground shooters clearer protections in court a law opposed by gun control advocates But against the backdrop of Parkland stand your ground became a political inflection point in July when a local sheriff declined to arrest a man who shot another in a dispute over a handicapped parking space at a Clearwater convenience store The shooter Michael Drejka was later charged by prosecutors but all the Democrats in the governors race called for the repeal of the law a move that could motivate black voters among whom opposition to the stand your ground policy resonates When asked last month about whether changes needed to be made over stand your ground in the Clearwater case Scott avoided answering the question but noted that violent crime has been declining in Florida on his watch Ill try to do everything I can to be responsive to always try and improve what happens We are at a year low in our crime rate Scott said But you hate anything like this happening Not only are the Democratic candidates for governor united behind a gun control message for the first time some congressional candidates are also taking up the mantle In Floridas th Congressional District in Miami former Judge Mary Barzee Flores has made Rep Mario DiazBalarts postParkland acceptance of NRA money a top campaign issue He hasnt faced a serious opponent since And back then guns werent an issue in his race Now DiazBalart has Barzee Flores as an opponent and shes being backed by Giffords the political committee founded by gunshot survivor and former Arizona Rep Gabby Giffords A poll from the group indicated that gun control could help shift the race in the Democrats favor Giffords is also backing Democrat Dave Shapiro against Rep Vern Buchanan in Floridas th District where the Republican incumbent attacked Shapiro for owning index funds that include gun investments even though Buchanan has similar stocks We have gone from a place where Republicans proudly touted NRA endorsement and unwavering support for the gun lobby to essentially using this as a hit against their Democratic opponents said Isabelle James political director for Giffords noting that gun safety is poised to have an impact this cycle like never before because candidates are talking about it like never before Indeed in Floridas th District Democrat Debbie MucarselPowell ran her first TV ad talking about how her father died from gunfire Her opponent Republican Rep Carlos Curbelo is one of the few members of his party to call for an assault weapons ban So has Rep Brian Mast a Republican in Floridas th Congressional District who made his support for the ban known in a splashy New York Times editorial after Parkland Aside from Barzee Flores race James said a Giffords poll in May of socalled battleground congressional seats across the nation including Florida showed that support for a generic Democrat running against a generic Republican increased from to percent once respondents heard that the Democrat favors gun control compared to a Republican who doesnt Independent support rose from percent to percent she said At the state legislative level guns have also become a bigger issue and are now ranked in the top three along with jobs health care and immigration according to surveys shared with POLITICO on condition the specific numbers or districts in question not be released In a May special election in Floridas th House District in Coral Gables the Republican and Democrat in the campaign advertised support for gun control a first for the GOP in the district Rep Matt Gaetz in Floridas st Congressional District a strong ally of

Florida to Montana over the next week He said Saturday he would also go to Pittsburgh in the wake of the shooting Earlier before boarding Air Force One Trump said the Pittsburgh incident may have ended differently had there been armed personnel inside the synagogue The comment could reopen a bitter debate over guncontrol laws and the political influence of the National Rifle Association less than two weeks from midterm elections If they had some kind of a protection inside the temple maybe it could have been a very much different situation Trump said adding that the US should stiffen up its death penalty laws Earlier Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the Department of Justice will file hate crimes and other charges against the defendant including ones that could lead to the death penalty History of Shootings We believe this is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States the AntiDefamation League a Jewish civil rights group

But the boycott inspired by the Florida shooting massacre has stalled at the first stronghold of resistance None of the videostreaming giants Apple Googles YouTube or Amazon the companys founder Jeffrey P Bezos owns the The Washington Post have acknowledged a petition and viral demands to take NRA videos offline If they do and the worlds largest tech corporations effectively declare the NRA a pariah boycotters have proposed plans to advance on the gun rights groups power centers its political capital and massive funding which for decades have made the NRA one of the most feared lobbies in the United States AD AD Or the boycott could end here and ultimately fail to change US gun laws or culture as other antiNRA campaigns have failed before The Sandy Hook Prologue The campaign went viral after the Feb massacre of people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School with a legally purchased AR rifle in Parkland Fla But the campaign has a prequel a similar movement launched six years ago when children and six adults were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary school in Newtown Conn Guncontrol advocates failed to hobble the NRA in which resisted calls for tighter gun laws then as it does after all mass shootings Nor was there anything like the string of corporate boycotts we see today But as The Washington Post wrote at the time the Newtown shooting accelerated Democratic politicians desertion of the NRA The organization which often says it is simply protecting the constitutional right of Americans to bear arms used to enjoy bipartisan political support I worry the NRA has become a captive of the Republican Party Rep Gene Green a Texas Democrat who supported the NRA told The Post in In the long run it will be weakened AD AD After the Sandy Hook campaign as CNN noted the NRAs contributions to Democratic politicians dropped to almost nothing By the NRA was producing apocalyptic videos that had almost nothing to do with guns and instead accused Democrats and reporters of tilting the United States into organized anarchy The Marjory Stoneman Douglas Campaign While the hashtag has floated around social media for years the movement exploded after a former student who owned at least guns was accused of shooting up the Parkland high school this month One of the first tweets to go semiviral was posted by a selfdescribed retired principal A few days later a combination of guncontrol activists teenage shooting survivors and liberal groups had turned the hashtag into a fullblown pressure campaign Any corporation with even a tangential affiliation to the NRA was called out with lists circulating across Twitter AD AD First National Bank of Omaha one of the largest private banks in the United States may have been the first to bow to the calls for boycott The bank announced Thursday a week after the shooting that it would discontinue its NRA Visa Card which had given the orgnizations members percent back on gas and sportinggoods purchases The rental car giant Enterprise followed suit a few hours later All three of our brands have ended the discount for NRA members effective March the car rental company wrote Thursday afternoon on Twitter Hertz Avis Budget Group and TrueCar would soon join Enterprise as would North American Van Lines and Allied Van Lines The companies faced a backlash from gun rights supporters but only a few corporations on the boycott list resisted By the end of Friday Symantec had announced that NRA members would have to pay the same price for its antivirus software as everyone else Chubb Limited insurance announced the end of a policy for NRA members who faced lawsuits for shooting people Chubb called the program NRA Carry Guard while critics had labeled it murder insurance The global insurance company MetLife ended its NRA member discount Best Western and Wyndham Hotels announced that they were no longer affiliated with the group AD AD Delta Air Lines held out against the pressure for a few hours A spokesman at first defended Deltas flight discounts to the NRAs annual convention in Dallas in May as routine for large groups The airline has more than such contracts in place a spokesman told the liberal outlet ThinkProgress on Friday night Come Saturday morning Delta abruptly discontinued the discounts and asked the NRA to remove the information about the perk from the convention website United Airlines released a nearly identical statement two hours later Some companies have held out FedEx for example still gives NRA Business Alliance members up to a percent discount on shipping expenses AD Still by the end of Saturday more than a dozen of the countrys larger corporations representing the travel software insurance banking and hospitality industries had all abandoned the NRA AD Nothing like that had happened after the Sandy Hook massacre in or any other gun massacre in modern US history The next battles In a statement released Saturday afternoon the NRA accused the corporations that dropped their discounts of a shameful display of political and civic cowardice but also dismissed the significance of their snubs Let it be absolutely clear the NRAs statement said The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world AD But is not yet satisfied By Saturday the boycott push was focused on tech giants that stream NRAproduced videos namely Amazon Apple Google and Roku NRATV a hour streaming channel is sometimes accused of being the groups propaganda arm After the Florida shooting the New York Times wrote its hosts spoke chillingly of leftist plots to confiscate weapons media conspiracies to brainwash Americans into supporting gun control and a deep state campaign to undermine President Trump AD Subsequently an online petition demanding that Amazon drop NRATV had amassed more than signatures by early Sunday morning with more added each second AD Some have also called for boycotts of any affiliated companies including The Post Bezos who owns The Post also owns Amazon Amazon Apple and Google have not responded to questions from The Post about the calls to drop NRATV or publicly acknowledged the campaign by early Sunday But the NRA which dismissed other boycott actions as trivial released a dire video message on NRATV equating calls to shut it down with an attack on free speech NRA leaders also spoke defiantly at public appearances last week blaming the fury against their organization on media manipulation Many in legacy media love mass shootings NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said Thursday at a conservative political conference Crying white mothers are ratings gold AD AD They want to make us all less free NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre said when he took the microphone The correct response to the Florida shooting he said was more armed security on school campuses not fewer guns in the United States Wars to come Pressure campaigns have become a favorite tool of liberal groups during Trumps presidency from early efforts to boycott Trumpbranded products to a Twitter campaign that identified and exposed people seen marching at a farright rally in Charlottesville this past summer Social media and Internet companies began to ban farright personalities from their sites after that rally turned violent For all the companies that have signed on to the latest NRA boycotts they have managed only to wipe out a few peripheral perks for the groups members The group claims million members and tens of millions in annual revenue According to Business Insider it is funded largely by the gun industry and it has converted much of that money into alliances and power networks across the US political system AD How far the boycott movement will spread is unknown But if it keeps up at the pace of the past three days there are signs it could threaten the political and financial cornerstones of the gun lobby After the Florida shooting a prominent City Council member in Dallas said the city no longer wants the NRA to hold its convention there in May even though Fox News reported that officials in Kansas and Nebraska have invited the gun groups business Florida Gov Rick Scott and other Republicans have endorsed banning rifle sales to anyone younger than which the NRA opposes Sen Marco Rubio RFla vowed at a town hall forum last week to keep accepting political contributions from the gun rights group and was met with a loud round of boos Even Trump has said that he expects the NRA to soon back new guncontrol measures according to Bloomberg News NRA opponents would love to hobble the groups revenue sources not to mention the gun industry which manufactures many of the hundreds of millions of guns in the country Although a long shot the feat may not be as impossible as it once seemed The gun industry is supported in part by widely held public stocks CNBC reported this week that some of Wall Streets largest exchangetraded funds include gunmakers in their portfolios But since the Florida shooting the investment giant BlackRock has been exploring ways of letting its clients disinvest from gun companies Bloomberg News reported And teachers in Florida are pressuring their pension fund managers to do the same Five days after the Stoneman Douglas shooting financial writer Andrew Ross Sorkin made a proposal in the New York Times Banks and credit companies could effectively stifle the sale of assault weapons simply by prohibiting customers from using their cards and services to buy these weapons Credit card companies already ban the purchase of cryptocurrency and other products Sorkin wrote If Visa and MasterCard banned assaultstyle weapons like the AR used in Florida assault weapons would be eliminated from virtually every firearms store in America because otherwise the sellers would be cut off from the credit card systems Some have also suggested that banks could throttle gun makers from the supply side by cutting off credit In the past that proposal has been a nonstarter In Snopes investigated a report that Bank of America was cutting off credit lines to gun manufacturers A spokeswoman for the bank denied the report saying it had no policies against doing business with the firearms industry and pointing to a million deal with a gunmaker that month Six years later amid the growing outrage over the Stoneman Douglas massacre the banks rhetoric sounds a bit different Axios reported Saturday that Bank of America was reexamining its relationship with AR rifle manufacturers that do business with it We are joining other companies in our industry to examine what we can do to help end the tragedy of mass shootings the bank said in a statement Correction An earlier version of this report included ATT among those streaming an NRA video channel It does not stream the channel

First lady Melania Trump Melania TrumpTrump tweets photo of himself wearing a mask Graham on the passing of Lewis He lived a consequential life First lady urges Americans to wear masks social distance MORE recently hosted a dinner for influential evangelical figures at the White House During his remarks President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump says he would be comfortable sending son grandchildren to school in person Cafeteria worker on White House grounds tests positive for COVID reports Republicans to start unveiling coronavirus package Thursday MORE briefly referenced the recent shooting at a gaming tournament in Jacksonville Florida A gunman with a history of mental illness killed two people and wounded others After expressing condolences to those affected Trump said dismissively how it happens nobody really knows We must wonder why the CommanderinChief of the United States who is charged with running the most complex operations of government not to mention its nuclear arsenal finds an event like the one in Jacksonville so mystifying After all it is his responsibility to oversee federal departments that conduct mandatory background checks on purchasers of firearms and one disqualifying criterion for wouldbe buyers is a history of mental illness The president was careful to remind evangelicals I have given you a lot Just about everything I promised If theres one axiom that describes Trumps political modus operandi it would be You scratch my back I scratch yours While hes delivered on his campaign promises to conservative evangelicals he has yet to deliver on his much more consequential promise to the nation made in his GOP nomination acceptance speech I was there in Cleveland and heard him say emphatically I have a message for all of you the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end Beginning on January th safety will be restored The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead ADVERTISEMENT The terrifying gun violence that plagues our nation has not come to an end and the horror that recently took place in Jacksonville has become all too familiar for Americans The last two years have been marked by gun violence and mass shootings shattering families and whole communities There are once again family members friends and too many others in unspeakable anguish after this most recent gun slaughter Trump needs to be reminded by faith leaders that every single human life matters not just the ones on a political promise list It is time for the president to take this moral mandate seriously and do everything possible to ensure the mentally unstable do not have access to firearms The Trump administration needs to push congress to tighten up federal law and allocate necessary resources to states to enforce such restrictions and to punish states that fail to do so Finally because our government is of the people by the people for the people it is also every Americans responsibility to elect those who defend the lives of its own citizens as more than simply campaign hype but as a sacred duty that must be performed and for which they must be held accountable Its time to elect members of Congress and other representatives at all levels of government who will hold this president accountable and craft legislation that keeps firearms out of the hands of those who present a grave danger to the public The Christian leaders at the White House dinner who heaped praise on Trump for giving them everything theyve demanded of him surely know that there is an explanation for the murder and mayhem in Jacksonville and Parkland and Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs and in the many dreadfully similar episodes of murder injury and trauma that preceded his presidency Simply put mental illness and access to deadly firearms should not go together Lets put that on our list of demands for the president and make sure that there are those in Washington who will make sure he delivers on themnot just for we evangelicals but for all of the American people Rev Rob Schenck PhD is an ordained evangelical minister and president of the Dietrich Bonhoeffer Institute located in Washington DC He is the author of Costly Grace An Evangelical Ministers Rediscovery of Faith Hope and Love Harper Collins June Rev Schenck is also a member of the leadership team for Survivor Sunday a nationwide day of remembrance for the lives lost annually to gun violence sponsored by Prayers Action,does president trump really not know why shootings in our country occur What is the government doing to combat it As far as that question goes a federal judge in California has issued a stay of an administrative order that bans the president from having guns in his car or house even though they are being held illegally under a constitutional amendment allowing the government to keep firearms on all Americans If the court finds that the ban violates the Second Amendment which says that individuals can carry all sorts of firearms,a guncontrol worker at a shooting range in jacksonville fla in A

New York Gov Andrew Cuomo is finding new allies in his campaign to bankrupt the National Rifle Association as three additional states follow his call to take legal action against the gunrights groups insurance program And an ethics watchdog anticipates more states could join It is troubling that we have seen the government targeting individuals and organizations to silence them based on their political positions Kendra Arnold executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust FACT told Fox News She cited similarities to the discovery that state AGs were cooperating to target skeptics of climate change In the latest case FACT has filed freedom of information requests with states including the four publicly targeting the NRA New York New Jersey California and Washington state in search of evidence that might show such coordination here The requests seek communications with any other Attorney General Governor or state insurance official that mention the National Rifle Association or Carry Guard Insurance Carry Guard is an NRAsponsored insurance policy for gun owners who use a firearm in selfdefense but face civil or criminal liability expenses State officials have specifically targeted the Overland Park Kansasbased Lockton Affinity and the Chicagobased Illinois Union a member of the Chubb group which were involved in marketing and selling the NRA insurance plans The New York Department of Financial Services in May levied a combined fine of more than million against the two companies On Aug Cuomo said I am calling on states across the country to join New York to outlaw this absurd program that insures intentional criminal conduct If the NRA goes bankrupt because of the State of New York theyll be in my thoughts and prayers The Democratic governor followed up in a letter to fellow governors requesting action against the NRA Cuomo is up for reelection in November facing Republican opponent Marcus Molinaro the Dutchess County executive Among his allies in this cause Washington state Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler commenced an investigation after issuing a ceaseanddesist order in April against the NRA concerning Carry Guard The Washington state Office of the Insurance Commissioner OIC was in touch with the New York state Department of Financial Services after it sent a letter on Aug to our commissioner Mike Kreidler Steve Valandra a spokesman for the insurance commissioner told Fox News in an email We found the policies sold by the NRA Carry Guard program were done without an insurance producer license a violation of Washington insurance law Valandra said That investigation began in following a consumer complaint Our current investigation following the ceaseanddesist order was prompted by concerns about whether the NRA Carry Guard program may have other consumer issues Last month the California Department of Insurance also issued a ceaseanddesist order against the NRA insurance alleging the NRA marketed the product without a license to do so in the state The Department of Insurance is not working with any other authority regarding the NRAs compliance issues with the sale of Carry Guard California Department of Insurance spokeswoman Nancy Kincaid told Fox News She said the state insists on full compliance with the California law that requires persons who solicit the purchase of insurance in California must be appropriately licensed to do so Kincaid said the NRA has not complied with that requirement which led to the administrative action to address the illegal conduct in California The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance also is investigating the NRA a probe that began in August after Cuomos invitation to other states A spokesperson from the New Jersey department did not respond to inquiries from Fox News NRA lawyer William Brewer pushed back on the state claims though telling Fox News the NRA conducted reviews to ensure compliance with state laws where Carry Guard is sold The NRA filed a First Amendment lawsuit against New York state that claims the policy restricting financial activity with progun organizations amounts to viewpoint discrimination A US Northern District of New York judge is mulling a motion to dismiss by the Cuomo administration For now the NRA is not focused on any other litigation beyond New York Brewer said Any state that makes an inquiry into the Carry Guard program the NRA will be quick to provide information as required unless we see the NRAs constitutional rights being violated Brewer said Both the NRA and FACT the ethics watchdog want to see whether New York and other states have made a concerted effort to target NRA finances We are interested in going into discovery in our case Brewer said You dont have to look far to see Gov Cuomo reaching out to other states asking them to take action against the NRA Fred Lucas is the White House correspondent for the Daily Signal,cuomos campaign to bankrupt nra by targeting insurance program spreads to more states allowing for a more comprehensive system This means the United States is now the least affected state by the United Nations and has the highest share of Medicaid claims

His exwife said he was unstable and beat her His father said he spoke openly of his disgust for gay people A coworker recalled him as a virulent racist Those who knew Omar Mateen the yearold Florida security guard who carried out the worst mass shooting in American history described him Sunday as an angry and disagreeable person But the roots of his rage and much else about his assault on a gay nightclub in Orlando remained unclear Was the killing of motivated by the homophobia Mateen spewed to his family and coworkers Or by the allegiance to Islamic State that he professed to a operator the night of the attack Or by a mental unraveling that drove his wife away after four months of marriage And what lay behind his choice of a target a Latin dance party at a club miles from his home Advertisement President Obama acknowledged the unanswered questions about Mateen at the White House but noted What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred Mateens outbursts and possible connection to terrorists attracted the attention of the FBI twice in recent years Agents questioned Mateen the Americanborn son of Afghan immigrants twice in after being told his coworkers suspected he might be linked to terrorists The colleagues reported that Mateen had made frightening claims that he had ties to terror groups including Al Qaeda a US law enforcement official said The Wall Street Journal reported that he also told colleagues he had connections with the brothers responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing FBI agents closed the investigation after they determined that Mateen didnt understand how the groups operated and he told investigators that he had been lying and blustering about his terrorist ties Advertisement Ultimately we were unable to verify the substance of his comments and the investigation was closed FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Ronald Hopper said Agents talked to him again in after learning he had attended the same mosque as Moner Mohammad Abusalha a yearold Floridian who joined a branch of Al Qaeda in Syria and killed himself and more than a dozen government soldiers in a truck bombing that year The FBI conducted an intensive investigation into Abusalha The investigation into Mateens relationship with Abusalha revealed that the two men probably knew each other by sight but were barely acquaintances Hopper told reporters in Orlando that agents determined the contact was minimal and did not constitute a substantive relationship or a threat at that time The FBI had placed Mateen on the terrorist watchlist during the investigations but removed him after he was cleared according to law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity Advertisement Mateen was born in New York and grew up in Florida He lived in Fort Pierce about a minute drive from his parents home in Port Saint Lucie Current and former neighbors described the area as ethnically mixed with immigrants from Haiti Guatemala and the Middle East His father Seddique Mateen is known in the global Afghan community from a TV show he hosts on a satellite network PayameAfghan TV about the national politics of his homeland and the ongoing conflict with Pakistan In one clip from the program Durand Jirga posted online last year the elder Mateen called the Taliban our warrior brothers in opposing Pakistan The network owner Omar Khatab said the father flew from Florida to California every three months to film broadcasts at the channels Canoga Park studio and expressed little interest in Islam He is not a religious guy Hes a secular guy Khatab said He loves America He has been here a long time He was a nice guy The son I dont know about Advertisement Mateens father told NBC News that the family was not aware he was planning an attack We are in shock like the whole country Seddique Mateen said Omar Mateen met Sitora Yusufiy the daughter of Uzbek immigrants online and married her in but the marriage was shortlived After a few months he started abusing me physically very often not allowing me to speak to my family Yusufiy said at a news conference in Boulder Colo where she lives She said that her parents rescued her after four months and that she and Mateen eventually divorced Advertisement As their marriage devolved she said she grew to believe he was mentally ill He was obviously disturbed she said People who knew him said he had a young son but the age of the child and Mateens relationship with the mother was unknown Mateen was employed since as a security guard for the international firm GS which provides services to corporations celebrities and foreign governments Daniel Gilroy who worked alongside Mateen for about a year as a security guard for a gated community said he brought a prayer rug and skullcap to work and prayed on his knees during his shifts Advertisement He didnt talk about his faith Gilroy said but was outspoken in his disdain for African Americans gays and women frequently using slurs and sometimes talking about committing violence against them Once when he saw an African American man driving past Gilroy recalled Mateen said he wished he could kill all blacks referring to them with the Nword You meet bigots Gilroy said But he was above and beyond He was always angry swearing just angry at the world Gilroy said that he complained but that the company did not intervene Representatives from GS did not immediately return requests for comment about Gilroys remarks In a statement earlier in the day the company said We are cooperating fully with all law enforcement authorities including the FBI as they conduct their investigation The company said Mateen underwent company screening and a background check in and repeated the process in with no problems The company was aware of the FBI inquiry Advertisement Mateen attended the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce a small mosque with about worshipers several times a week Just last Friday he prayed with his young son But the centers imam said he did not really know him He was a quiet shy guy Imam Syed Shafeeq Rahman said Come last go first The imam said he hadnt had a conversation with Mateen in a decade and couldnt reconcile his actions with the teachings of Islam In the mosque there is no extremism he said Mateens father told NBC News that he believed homophobia not religion led his son to kill The father recalled a visit to Miami earlier this year where his son became angry with displays of affection by gay men Advertisement We were in downtown Miami Bayside people were playing music And he saw two men kissing each other Seddique Mateen said And then we were in the mens bathroom and men were kissing each other Omar Mateen bought two guns he used in the rampage an assaulttype rifle and a semiautomatic pistol legally in the last two weeks at a gun store near his home federal officials said Near the time he opened fire in the nightclub Mateen placed a call to and told the operator that he pledged allegiance to Islamic state and specifically mentioned the Tsarnaev brothers who were responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing two US law enforcement officials said In a live broadcast Sunday afternoon on PayameAfghan the network that aired Mateens fathers show an unidentified man speaking in English expressed dismay at the attacks Advertisement Its not the work of all Afghans Its not the work of all Muslims he said We are so sad this happened especially for those defenseless people gathering in a nightclub pursuing the happiness they wanted to obtain His exwife had not talked to Mateen for seven years and reflecting on their time together said he practiced his faith and showed no signs of interest in radical Islam He talked about becoming a police officer But then there was his temper When he would get in his tempers he would express hate toward everything she said ALSO Advertisement Obamas full remarks on Orlando nightclub shooting Pride attendees march and mourn

This is not a time to jump to some conclusion not knowing the full facts House Speaker Paul D Ryan RWis said at his weekly news briefing Weve got a lot more information we need to know AD Once again we see the urgency for Congress to take true commonsense action to prevent gun violence House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi DCalif said at her weekly briefing just before Ryan spoke AD But there is no real urgency on Capitol Hill to do anything Republicans generally support gun rights and enjoy the political support of the National Rifle Association Democrats despite polling showing broad support for more gun regulation seldom campaign on the issue and therefore put almost no fear in GOP lawmakers that they will pay a political price for their inaction In fact in rural areas Democrats are openly campaigning as gun lovers in an effort to appeal to hunters AD Still loves to shoot the narrator said in the first ad aired by Conor Lamb the Democrat running a surprisingly competitive race for a special election for a House seat in southwestern Pennsylvania Six seconds into the introductory ad the former federal prosecutor is shown firing a rifle The only legislation directly related to gun violence is sitting in the Senate after the House gave its approval in December But it is a mixed bag including provisions that would eliminate loopholes in the federal background check system while also including the NRAs highest priority expanding the ability of Americans to carry concealed weapons across state lines AD Democrats oppose the concealedcarry provision And in the Senate where it would require or more Democrats to support the bill to clear a filibuster the legislation seems to have ground to a halt AD The October massacre of people at a Las Vegas music festival led many Republicans to consider the ban of an accessory a bump stock that shooters can use to turn a semiautomatic rifle into a fully automatic weapon A bump stock allowed the killer to inflict mass casualties never before seen in activeshooter situations Rather than take up legislation Ryan decided to follow the lead of the officials at the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives which received letters from Republicans asking ATF to declare that bump stocks violated the law The rulemaking process at federal agencies takes time Four months after the request from Capitol Hill the agency has just finished the public comment period AD AD ATF has not said when the regulatory issue will be resolved Congress could preempt that and just pass a legislative fix but there are no signs of movement Ryan pointed to the passage of the st Century Cures Act that included an expansion of federal officials working to improve mental health including a new office inside the Health and Human Services Department We passed legislation on mental health We want to make sure that if someones in the mental health system that they dont get a gun if theyre not supposed to get a gun he said That bill passed in December the last month of Barack Obamas presidency The typical Republican response to this shooting and other mass shootings is to ask for more time to study the issue Over the coming days I hope to have a full account of what happened what was known before this tragedy said Sen Cory Gardner RColo AD AD Eight months after a mass shooting at a movie theater in Colorado the state approved laws that created stricter background checks and limited the size of bullet magazine clips Gardner said he was not ready to discuss similar federal laws He also deflected attention from the alleged shooters use of a semiautomatic AR rifle turning instead to how the school system and other local officials handled the warning signs of the yearolds troubled background Theres a lot of red flags that seemed to have been visible he said Democrats have grown increasingly frustrated by GOP leaders who offer up thoughts and prayers to victims families after mass shootings while not considering legislation to enforce greater gun control AD Look what we need to do is address this issue Frankly we want to look at this comprehensively and were going to undertake action to do just that and try to come up with some comprehensive solution House Minority Whip Steny H Hoyer DMd told reporters AD Hoyer noted that Democrats have gone to great lengths to highlight the issue including an overnight protest on the House floor just after the massacre in an Orlando nightclub in June As Pelosi and Hoyer noted Thursday the only outcome from that was an investigation into what rules Democrats broke on the House floor Very disappointing Hoyer said A month later in her presidential nomination acceptance speech in Philadelphia Hillary Clinton highlighted the issue and called for commonsense reforms to keep guns out of the hands of criminals,on capitol hill little chance of a legislative response to latest mass shooting But I would like to think that what happened is not just one man saying at the top of his lungs that all three rounds of gun control should be legal Its a lot of people thinking differently than he did I think that even if the NRA would change its position the number of members willing to share their opposition with the community on a public forum would be very small But I can,speaker paul d ryan at a news briefing on tuesday RT January This is a fact

Students across the country participated in school walkouts this week to demand action on gun violence and two more widespread walkouts are planned for the next two months on March to mark one month since the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida and on April the th anniversary of the Columbine shooting A major Washington DC demonstration the March for Our Lives is set for March The protests are drawing attention not just for their impassioned plea but for the ways in which various school districts are reacting to the organized action Students expressing anger over gun violence in the form of protests are being met with disciplinary action at some schools Photo Getty Images Consequences for students participating in walkouts have been drastically different across the country At Needville High School in Texas students were threatened with a threeday suspension if they participated in the walkouts according to a note posted on the schools Facebook page by Needville Independent School District superintendent Curtis Rhodes The Needville ISD is very sensitive to violence in schools including the recent incident in Florida the note said There is a movement attempting to stage walkoutsdisruptions of the school through social media andor media outlets Please be advised that the Needville ISD will not allow a student demonstration during school hours for any type of protest or awareness Should students choose to do so they will be suspected from school for days and face all the consequences that come along with an out of school suspension The schools Facebook page has since been taken down but the note which went viral after it was posted on Tuesday was captured in screengrabs Life is all about choices and every choice has a consequence whether it be positive or negative We will discipline no matter if it is one fifty or five hundred students involved Rhodes wrote adding that even those who had notes from parents would not be spared from discipline and asking the community to understand that we are here for an education and not a political protest Story continues Photo Getty Images Other school districts made similar threats According to the Los Angeles Times Steven Walts superintendent of Prince William County Va Public Schools wrote an email to parents and students noting that there would be disciplinary consequences for students who cause disruptions or leave school without authorization On the other end of the spectrum Jerry Kalina principal of PapillionLa Vista High School in Omaha Neb joined his students for a minute walkout on Wednesday one minute for each of the Parkland victims I thought if kids are going to walk out I want it to be controlled and I want it to be a respectful situation in which our kids focus on the victims and their families Kalina tells Yahoo Lifestyle So I got on the intercom and we took a moment of silence for the victims and I told the students that if they plan to walk out that was their choice and they wouldnt get in trouble When the bell rang to end the class period at Kalina says about kids joined him outside in degree weather I roamed around the crowd kids were worried they had looks on their faces I hadnt seen before he says I wanted to let them know that we are here for them and to show some compassion and love I didnt want to be a dictator I wanted students to know that hopefully this is the start of something that will create change In St Charles Ill administrators took a similar approach Once we were made aware of the walkout the high school principal sent a message to staff saying that if a student tells you they are walking out please allow them to do so Carol Smith St Charles School District spokesperson tells Yahoo Lifestyle We made sure there was supervision Students met under the flagpole They had conversations about what this meant and when the minutes were up they went back to school Smith says that at St Charles North High School about students participated in the walkout and at St Charles East there were between and That discrepancy Smith says is likely because two St Charles East students were killed as a result of gun violence just last year Its been very very difficult so these students understood what they were doing she says As one of our students said We may not be able to vote yet but were a movement Were starting to show people that we care and that we can make a difference As a school district how can we say no to that How can we discourage them from doing something they are passionate about and they feel can make a difference about on a national level Plenty of schools seem to still be hashing out how they will handle the upcoming walkouts On Tuesday Todd Gray the superintendent of the Waukesha School District in Wisconsin sent an email suggesting that those who participated in a walkout would face disciplinary action according to the Journal Sentinel By Wednesday Gray had amended his message explaining that students would be allowed to participate if given permission by a parent Legally schools can discipline students who ditch class for any reason according to a blog post by Vera Eidelman a William J Brennan fellow with the ACLUs Speech Privacy and Technology Project But what the school cant do is discipline students more harshly because they are walking out to express a political view or because school administrators dont support the views behind the protest she writes In other words any disciplinary action for walking out cannot be a response to the content of the protest Much of the backlash against Rhodes the Texas superintendent who threatened suspension seemed to be the result of the content of his message Its a quintessential First Amendment violation and most Americans have an instinct about that Georgetown Law professor Heidi Li Feldman told the Washington Post Whats really weird about this is that they announced they will suspend people over the content of their offcampus protest Contentbased restrictions on speech are anathema to the First Amendment So this looks like a total problem Back in Omaha meanwhile Kalina says he believes that any good school administrator should react to specific situations rather than apply a blanket rule as moments like these come up You have to use the common sense approach you have to be compassionate I could sense even as our day started on Wednesday that things were different theyve been different since this happened Kids seem on edge he says noting that minutes of the school day wouldnt be especially disruptive to a school that goes through seven fiveminute class changes a day Young people need to be heard we have to trust them and give them boundaries and a controlled setting and let them know that were here for them I didnt want to talk suspension and punishment thats not what my students needed to hear They needed to hear the opposite that they will be taken seriously and they will be safe Read more from Yahoo Lifestyle Follow us on Instagram Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed every day,why some schools are suspending kids for joining

Austin AFP The US cryptoanarchist who caused panic this week by publishing online blueprints for Dprinted firearms said Wednesday that whatever the outcome of a legal battle he has already succeeded in his political goal of spreading the designs far and wide A federal court judge blocked Texan Cody Wilsons website on Tuesday by issuing a temporary injunction Eight states had sued arguing the blueprints could allow anyone from a teen to a lone wolf gunman to make untraceable undetectable plastic weapons Wilson complied with the judges order and shut down his Defcad website which he wanted to turn into the WikiLeaks of guns But by then the blueprints he had posted after President Donald Trumps administration granted him permission to publish in a settlement to end a fiveyear legal battle had been downloaded thousands of times No matter how badly I win or lose you can download a gun from the internet Wilson told AFP at the headquarters of Defense Distributed the company he runs out of a modest factory in Texas capital Austin This attempt by these authorities to go into court and stifle this information drove more people to the website to download it and spread it deeper into the internet Sporting a pair of gray jeans and a dark blue tshirt the yearold with a closecropped beard wouldnt appear out of place as a tech executive in Silicon Valley The ideology he says he is driven by is a defense of the US constitutions first and second amendments the rights to free speech and to bear arms Wilson believes the intense media attention he generated cemented one of his principal goals to use technology and the spread of gunmaking information as a permanent bulwark against any future attempts at gun control in the US We believe that the firearm itself this implement of violence is an essential component of force of sovereignty he says He concedes that what he has done and still wants to do offends the conscience of some people but he says its never been illegal in this country to make a firearm and the way that you make it shouldnt affect that law Story continues Anarchist philosophy Wilson subscribes to an anarchist philosophy that the free exchange of ideas on the internet in its absolute form is a check on government Its a politics that predicted WikiLeaks predicted Bitcoin predicted anonymous mail and anonymous communications online he says The law school dropout has dedicated the last five years of his life to the cause of unfettered online access to gunmaking information Im a publisher At the end of the day I do many things but the main thing that I strive to do is to take my information and put it on the internet he says Defense Distributed the company Wilson cofounded in and currently heads is more than a publishing firm it sells actual firearms products It has created a machine called the Ghost Gunner priced at Computer code operates the machine which carves essential components of various firearms to create weapons without serial numbers Ghost guns Such weapons called ghost guns are already being made by those who can properly carve metal components The Ghost Gunner takes away the need for advanced skill and creates untraceable weapons The issue is far from academic The Los Angeles Police Department last month showcased a trove of ghost weapons it recovered from gang members Law enforcement cannot trace these weapons if they are used to commit crimes That is why lawmakers law enforcement personnel gun control groups and even Trump himself expressed everything from panic to skepticism this week when Wilson started distributing blueprints online Those blueprints included his companys own creation the Liberator plastic gun a sidearm that resembles something seen on science fiction TV shows The potential impact of Wilsons publication was worldwide Any country with uncensored access to the internet could see its gun control measures circumvented with a click of a mouse It is immediately obvious to anyone who looks at this issue that Dprinted guns are nothing short of a menace to society said Avery Gardiner copresident of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence We will continue to do everything in our power to make sure that this temporary halt in publication becomes a permanent one Gardiner said after the injunction Wilson also plans to fight just as he unsuccessfully fought in the courts for five years The judge that ordered his website shut plans to hold a hearing on the states lawsuit next week Wilson put out a call for donations to fund the legal challenge but is aware that he may be facing a losing battle I believe that duty demands that I continue to fight it he said while admitting that I think Ill waste a lot of money,us cryptoanarchist sees dprinted guns as fundamental right for citizens His comments include what he claims to support in the form of the Gang of Four movement In a series of comments by his blog which was created by him on his own blog Mr Tawes claimed that one of the key arguments raised in the debate about the decentralised internet is the idea that the internet is completely anonymous,cody wilson the founder of defense distortion at

Miss Emma and everybody that will be marching Love Do not let hate win Love Brooks said during Inside Studio G his weekly Facebook video series This Saturday Be a part of it While lots of Alist celebrities have supported the march Brookss statement stands out as Nashville stars typically avoid sharing their thoughts about gunrelated issues even after the mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas in October But Brookss comments show how some country singers are starting to speak out on the subject even if the singers dont say anything political or even mention the word gun Conventional wisdom in Nashville is that country singers shouldnt talk about anything controversial because they dont want to alienate their audience or anger country radio which can make or break an artists career The topic of guns is seen as especially polarizing given the National Rifle Associations close ties to the industry However Rolling Stone reported this week that NRA Country the lifestyle arm of the NRA recently revamped its website and removed the names of all country singers affiliated with the brand Popular acts such as Florida Georgia Line and Thomas Rhett had already been deleted after the Las Vegas shooting AD AD I can only guess that after the Parkland shooting there were a lot more acts that felt queasy about having their name directly associated with the NRA David Macias the president of management company Thirty Tigers told the magazine When a gunman shot and killed people last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland some Nashville stars spoke up with fervor Tim McGraw posted on Instagram Im deeply moved by these students who are lifting their voices challenging us to listen learn and make real changes Cam wrote on Twitter This is not the America we are capable of Please get upset Others were critical of the government Jennifer Nettles of the recently reunited duo Sugarland tweeted More than anything else people who want to hurt as many innocent children as they can use guns to do it I wonder how long it will take our government to do anything at all I wonder how loudly the voices of every mother in this country can scream til they do The duo Brothers Osborne wrote Nothing will be done Nothing AD AD Some of these stars are already fairly vocal about current events McGraw and his wife Faith Hill have previously called for stricter gun control and Cam was one of the artists who pushed back last fall when the Country Music Association tried to ban reporters at the CMA Awards from asking questions about guns or politics And Brothers Osborne siblings TJ and John arent shy about taking on controversial topics on social media A lot of people are like Stay out of politics I dont care if you agree with me or not or I agree with you or not we should all be involved in politics because it affects every single one of us TJ Osborne recently told the Nashville Tennessean in an article about how country singers are becoming less fearful about getting Dixie Chickd blacklisted from country radio after sharing their political views as that trio did in with its criticism of President George W Bush In that sense its notable when country acts who rely on mainstream radio say anything On March one month after the Parkland shooting when students across the country walked out of schools to call for stronger guncontrol legislation Kelsea Ballerini tweeted an image of the walkout and wrote This is heavy but so brave and beautiful My heart is with these students all over the world who are walking out boldly letting their voices be heard for a change and honoring their friends classmates and strangers who have been taken AD AD Although it was not a political statement Ballerini still got the typical responses Multiple people on Twitter praised her sentiment Love love LOVE you for using your voice to support this movement and another went with How about you stick to singing Weve all seen what happens to celebrities who get political Some country singers are not fazed by those threats For example Maren Morris doesnt hold back her thoughts on social issues yet country radio has increasingly embraced her music At a party in Nashville last month celebrating her first No single Morris addressed that phenomenon saying that although the Dixie Chicks fallout still looms in Nashville she feels the atmosphere has shifted I dont think watering yourself down ends up gaining you more fans I deal with it every time I say something a little more outspoken its like you lose a thousand followers but the ones that stick with you are really really in it with you for good said Morris who called Gonzlez the Stoneman Douglas High student an inspiration in an Instagram post The Dixie Chicks comparison is a very easy thing to say when someone says something you dont agree with But I think that people dont even think that way anymore really its changed so much since all of that went down Im just not threatened by that thrown out at me anymore,country singers usually stay quiet about gun issues but since parkland some are speaking out against it Last year a small group of singers from Colorado Oklahoma Massachusetts Virginia and Arizona issued a joint statement that said if their own parks were taken over they would be violently affected and their own lives at risk In November the California band the Mountain States posted a Facebook post that read Its easy to see why people go crazy for their favorite singer,tim mcgraw of the country band sugarland has been criticized for his comments about gun issues We can make our own decisions in this world about their lives because Im not one of them I think that when we talk about it in our conversations we will get an answer You hear people say its a good thing for the gunrights movement and that the Second Amendment protects us mcgraw told The Associated Press But I think there,0
Nam Y Huh FileAP After Democrats found widespread victorys in the midterm elections From New York to New Mexico residents in a number of states can expect a leftward push for expanded health care coverage gun control education funding and legalized recreational marijuana as Democrats who gained new or stronger powers in the midterm elections seek to put their stamp on public policy While Republicans remain in charge in more states Democrats nearly doubled the number of places where they will wield a trifecta of power over the governors office and both chambers of the state legislature Democrats also broke up several Republican strongholds forcing GOP lawmakers who have been cutting taxes and curbing union powers to deal with a new reality of a Democratic governor All told Democrats gained seats in of the partisan state legislative chambers according to data provided by the National Conference of State Legislatures Nebraska is the lone state with a single nonpartisan chamber Democrats also added seven new governorships In New York where a new Democraticrun Senate will provide the missing link in liberals political power the expansive agenda could go beyond guns pot and health care to also include more protections for abortions rights and higher taxes on millionaires We will finally give New Yorkers the progressive leadership they have been demanding said Sen Andrea StewartCousins who stands to lead the Senate when the new session begins in January The US is a deeply divided nation politically a fact reflected in a midterm vote that gave Democrats the US House while adding to the Republican majority in the US Senate But within states the overall outcome of the elections was a continued trend of oneparty control Democrats in some places Republicans in others For the first time since there will be only one state Minnesota with its two legislative chambers led by different parties If Republican gubernatorial candidates maintain their slim leads in Florida and Georgia Republicans will hold full control over the governors office and legislative chambers in states compared with for Democrats Just states will have a split partisan control between the governors office and legislature nearly matching the year low point set in There also has been a decrease in ticketsplitting between governors and state attorneys general with the number of such divisions expected to decline from to as a result of Tuesdays elections This is the most hyperpolarized hyperpartisan time weve see in generations and nobody can deny that said Illinois state Sen Toi Hutchinson a Democrat who is president of the National Conference of State Legislatures Illinois is one of a halfdozen states where Tuesdays election put Democrats in control of the governors office and legislature Democrat JB Pritzker who ousted Republican Gov Bruce Rauner wants to legalize and tax recreational marijuana He also has promised to push for a constitutional amendment to replace Illinois flat income tax system with a progressive one that requires the wealthy to pay a greater share Democrats also are planning aggressive agendas in other states where they expanded their political power Nevada is expected to pass a ban on bump stocks on guns as the state Legislature meets for the first time since the October mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip Democrats also will be pushing to spend more on education expand Medicaid coverage raise the minimum wage and require employers to provide paid sick leave In New Mexico Democratic Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth said minimum wage and teacher pay increases will be at the top of the agenda Democrats also could overhaul the states approach to climate change gun control and marijuana In Colorado Democrats are planning a renewed push to expand health coverage adopt gun controls boost public education funding and enhance environmental protections In Maine new Democratic Govelect and Attorney General Janet Mills has vowed to finally expand Medicaid as voters demanded in a referendum but which has been slowed by her Republican predecessor The states shifting to Democratic dominance can look to New Jersey which

Rep Lou Barletta As I go to work at the US Capitol I pass vehicle barricades armed guards metal detectors and police dogs Yet while my colleagues and I go to work every day without any fear of attacks our teachers and students go to school hoping that nothing happens to them Its embarrassing and unacceptable If we as government officials can protect ourselves we can do the same for our students We can all recall stories from when we were in high school and remember the friends we made and experiences we had in elementary school and junior high Our schools are a place of memories and many of us cherish the days we spent there Unfortunately todays children dont share those kinds of memories because of the increased amount of violence in our schools As the father of four daughters two of whom are schoolteachers and the grandfather of eight this is an issue that hits very close to home for me No student should ever go to school in fear and no parent should have to send their child to school with the possibility of never seeing them again Schools need to have the means to implement security measures that work best for their students and the federal government needs to provide the guidance and support for them to do so MoreAfter Parkland reject nothing can be done look for new solutions John Walsh MoreDont forget everyday gun reforms Bo Dietl Thats why I introduced the Protecting Our Kids Act which would direct the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Education to work together to provide schools with security standards and guidelines within days of becoming law so that educators and administrators can have the tools they need to protect their students If we can provide safety guidelines for federal buildings across the country there is no reason why we cant do the same for our schools There is no onesizefitsall plan that will work for all schools across the country Thats why my bill would not mandate any blanket security protocols but rather provide an additional tool for schools to use to determine what improvements can be made that best fit the unique needs of their students and teachers Securing our schools and prioritizing the safety of our nations children should not be a difficult decision for Washington Responding to school violence is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue Yet we find ourselves in the same situation tragedy after tragedy failing to take action while conversations about longterm solutions take place When a crazed gunman shot up the congressional baseball practice last year threatening the lives of several of my colleagues the response was instant Republicans and Democrats alike came together and acted There was an increase in security to protect members of Congress an increase to protect our staff More money started flowing to secure our district offices We could even use the newly found money to secure our homes The funding went out the door to help protect us immediately while other discussions continued to happen MoreMarch for Our Lives School shooting debate needs to go beyond guns POLICING THE USA A look at race justice media People move fast here when they are worried about their safety about the safety of their family and friends Why cant we move at the same speed when it comes to the safety of our nations students My life is no more important than that of any parents child across America Teachers and students across our country go to school each day hoping that today is not the day while I go to work without any fear and that is inexcusable If Congress can protect itself there is no reason it cant do the same for Americas schools The sad reality is that our nations schools are dangerously undersecured and programs to increase school security are dangerously underfunded Thats why I have urged my colleagues in Congress to double the funding provided for grant programs that help schools purchase metal detectors locks and other security enhancements and implement anonymous reporting systems and school threat assessment protocols to deter violence before it occurs I plan to continue fighting for this funding and for the sake of our nations children I hope my colleagues listen We must act now before more innocent lives are lost Our children deserve to grow up in a safe learning environment free of fear and violence where they are able to make memories like the ones we have that can still make us smile decades later When it comes to school safety we cant waste another day talking instead of acting Republican Rep Lou Barletta represents Pennsylvanias th Congressional District Follow him on Twitter ,we in congress should protect students from gun violence as well as we protect ourselves from violence in future the speaker said We need more time to get on with it to start moving forward with our plan to end the NRAs legacy,a memorial for the victims of the shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla on monday The event was held

WASHINGTON The US Supreme Court said Tuesday it will not take up an appeal to Californias day waiting period for gun buyers acting as the issue of gun control is once more in the national spotlight after last weeks school shooting in Florida Justice Clarence Thomas said the court should have taken up the challenge The refusal to do so he said is a sign that the Second Amendment is a disfavored right in this Court Gun rights advocates challenged Californias law in court claiming it is unconstitutional A trial court ruled in their favor concluding that the law did not serve an important governmental interest But the th Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco reversed that ruling And now the Supreme Court is leaving that appeals court ruling intact Thomas noted that the Supreme Court has not touched the gun rights issue for nearly a decade since ruling that the Second Amendment provides an individual right to have a handgun at home for self defense The right to keep and bear arms is apparently this Courts constitutional orphan Thomas wrote in a dissent No other justice joined him on it Under the California law at issue a buyer must wait days before the seller can hand over a firearm a rifle shotgun or a handgun Eight other states have waiting periods Only Hawaiis day period is longer Those states say those delays have two advantages allowing time for a thorough background check and providing a coolingoff period allowing people who might guy a gun to harm themselves or others a chance to calm down,supreme court wont hear challenge to california gun waiting period Jason Zick February This is not the first time the state has successfully challenged the ability of some people to buy handguns Last week two of the women in the Supreme Court and a third woman died and police officials believe their cases will be tried before the case goes to trial before the next district court judge This story corrects the quote,the supreme court will not take up an appeal to californias day waiting period for gun buyers The decision should not come as a surprise to Californians because there really is nothing to distinguish this state from California LOral president and CEO of the statebased firm Joseph Prez said in an interview last Friday California should make gun control an essential part of our national health and safety policy and our education,1

A retired Supreme Court justice believes the March for Our Lives protesters are aiming too low by asking lawmakers simply to reform the nations gun laws The demonstrators should seek more effective and more lasting reform John Paul Stevens wrote in a New York Times oped published on Tuesday They should demand a repeal of the Second Amendment Stevens argues that the amendment which states a well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed was born out of concern that a national standing army might pose a threat to the security of individual states and is a relic of the th century In Stevens was among four dissenters in the Supreme Courts decision in a landmark case District of Columbia v Heller that held the Second Amendment protects an individuals right to bear arms for selfdefense That decision which I remain convinced was wrong and certainly was debatable has provided the NRA with a propaganda weapon of immense power Stevens wrote in his oped Overturning that decision via a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the NRAs ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option Slideshow Scenes from March for Our Lives rallies around the world Protesters at a March For Our Lives rally in Sacramento Calif on Saturday Photo Bob StrongReuters More Hundreds of thousands of people participated in Saturdays antigunviolence marches in Washington DC and numerous locations throughout the country demanding Congress act to protect students in the wake of last months massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Fla Many of the demonstrators chastised the gun lobby on signs and in speeches while expressing support for stricter background checks an increase in the minimum age to buy certain firearms and a ban on semiautomatic weapons But most did not call for an outright repeal of the Second Amendment as Stevens is suggesting That simple but dramatic action would move Saturdays marchers closer to their objective than any other possible reform he wrote It would eliminate the only legal rule that protects sellers of firearms in the United States unlike every other market in the world It would make our schoolchildren safer than they have been since and honor the memories of the many indeed far too many victims of recent gun violence National polls show broad support for measures to reduce gun violence including universal background checks age restrictions and a ban on assault weapons A Fox News poll released on Sunday found percent of American voters believe protecting citizens from gun violence is more important than protecting the right of citizens to own guns compared to percent who believe the opposite At the White House on Tuesday press secretary Sarah Sanders said that the president and the administration still fully support the Second Amendment We think the focus has to remain on removing weapons from dangerous individuals not on blocking all Americans from their constitutional rights Sanders said Meanwhile gun rights activists say the weekend demonstrations were an attack on the Second Amendment In Washington on Saturday David Hogg a Parkland survivor and one of the organizers of the March for Our Lives criticized television pundits for painting him as antigun Theyve made it seem like Im trying to take away peoples guns that Im against the Second Amendment Hogg said My father is a retired FBI agent I have guns in my house Im not against the Second Amendment Cameron Kasky another Marjory Stoneman Douglas student made a similar point on Fox News Sunday,former supreme court justice stevens repeal the second amendment that prevents abortion providers from withholding abortion services replacing it with one that provides reasonable barriers to admitting women seeking abortions making it clear that abortion providers may seek to restrict health care access and the availability of services that they deem medically unnecessary the federal judge says Here at LifeSiteNews weve worked to make sure every woman has access to our most trusted health care information source health provider reports birth and,a rally in washington dc on saturday I was in the front row during it It was the most beautiful display Ive seen all day and I couldnt help feeling like that was a sign of respect A guy was shouting that No no And they all stared at me and said No then they kept on shouting No no and I looked at my back and thought It will be okay I think it was,1

FILE PHOTO Rifles are seen at the Sturm Ruger Co Inc gun factory in Newport New Hampshire January REUTERSEric ThayerFile Photo By Ross Kerber BOSTON Reuters Funds run by BlackRock Inc BLKN and Vanguard Group backed all directors at gunmaker Sturm Ruger Co Inc RGRN despite the companys rare rejection of talks with the worlds top asset managers disclosures to regulators on Thursday showed The votes by the gunmakers largest investors stood in contrast to support BlackRock and Vanguard gave to a measure calling on Sturm Ruger to report on the safety of its products which passed over the boards objections at the companys annual meeting on May Neither BlackRock nor Vanguard would discuss in detail their votes at the meeting It drew attention amid a nationwide youthled gun control movement following a mass shooting at a Florida high school in February that killed people one in a decadeslong series of shootings at US schools colleges and workplaces Sturm Ruger declined to comment on the filings by the funds with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday BlackRock holds about percent of shares outstanding followed by Vanguard with about percent Both fund firms rarely vote against directors and say critical votes may come only after companies fail to respond to shareholder concerns Since July BlackRock and Vanguard said in separate investment stewardship reports that they had held talks with other US public companies that make or sell civilian firearms Investors and activists with a range of views about gun control said the asset managers split tickets seemed to reflect an approach designed to appeal to young investors concerned with social issues without alienating clients who own guns or pushing Sturm Rugers board too quickly The big fund firms have to look at sensitivities of their clients and business partners said Brian Rafn principal of Morgan Dempsey Capital Management in Milwaukee who described himself as a gunrights supporter and says the firm voted all its or so shares with Sturm Rugers management Eli KasargodStaub cofounder of Majority Action a group that had campaigned for top funds to vote against Sturm Ruger director Sandra Froman a past president of the National Rifle Association called the votes a failure of leadership by the fund managers The only plausible explanation to me is that they were simply trying to avoid controversy he said BlackRock spokeswoman Tara McDonnell said via email it takes a casebycase approach to its engagement and voting because doing so encourages change over time and promotes responsible business practices that align with the financial interests of our clients In a statement emailed by spokeswoman Carolyn Wegemann Vanguard said that while a companys willingness to engage can affect its voting decisions corporate moves to improve shareholder value may unfold over the course of a few years rather than a few months Sturm Ruger is unusual in that its executives and directors will not talk with investors directly at a time both big passive managers have stressed more engagement with companies in their portfolios Sturm Ruger Chief Executive Officer Christopher Killoy at the May meeting said it does not meet with top holders including BlackRock and Vanguard because of fairdisclosure rules a rare stance BlackRock voted against Exxon directors over similar discussion limits in the past and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink earlier this year told CEOs that engagement needs to be a yearround conversation about improving longterm value BlackRock and Vanguard said they would contact gunmakers after the Florida shooting Sturm Ruger said previously its directors each won more than million votes at the May meeting The most votes withheld from any director was Thursdays filings showed funds including BlackRocks iShares Core SP SmallCap ETF IJRP and Vanguard SmallCap Index Fund VBP voted for all nine directors and for the safety report In a July investment stewardship report BlackRock said it had talks with nearly all US public gun manufacturers or sellers The company also said that at one unidentified gunmaker that did not allow shareholder talks it voted for a safety report Vanguards similar report in midAugust said that during the months ended June it spoke with three gunmakers and supported a shareholder resolution calling for more risk disclosure at a company it did not identify Vanguard wrote that in its outreach our objective is not to change what business a company is in or what product it produces but rather to ensure that the risks of these choices are understood by the market and reflected in the companys longterm value to investors Reporting by Ross Kerber editing by Grant McCool,limited engagement top funds backed gunmaker ruger board despite no talks of new license So the question is if somebody is going to make a donation of percent or percent of one percent to this organization that will allow them to donate

Washington CNN Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trumps response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence When he goes around getting people to scream and hate bad things happen and you saw the results here said Bloomberg He went on to say that the President should be unifying and instead he is exciting people inciting people Bloomberg who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words The Presidents words matter more than anybody else and his job Ive always thought is to be a unifier not to be the leader of a party but to be the leader of this country Bloomberg said The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting as well last weeks series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN Bloomberg said perhaps Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way You dont use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise Bloomberg said Thats not what the President should be doing The Presidents words matter Hes not an average person Hes the President and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people Bloomberg was careful however not to lay blame on Republicans generally Not every Republican is a racist he said Not every Republican agrees with the President When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires Bloomberg George Soros and Tom Steyer were buying the midterms Bloomberg responded I think he shouldnt The good thing is nobody knows who he is Bloomberg also said there are an awful lot of Democrats that dont stand up Theres plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides Bloomberg said But I do think that if you look the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House Yet to decide on Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in saying he is focused on the November midterms The former New York mayor recently reregistered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms The billionaire has pumped more than million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden who Bloomberg described as a competent American jumps in the race I have a case to present if Id like to present it Bloomberg said And if the public likes it thats fine and if they dont thats what freedom of choice is Bloomberg said if he were to run he would present his record as somebody who actually does things and hopes voters would be receptive Bloomberg said while he thought a large percentage of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries though he said he rejects some of the partys positions I dont agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions Bloomberg said I come from a world of being practical Having grand schemes that we probably cant afford that a lot of people wouldnt like is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years Calls for gun control Bloomberg who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest Earlier Monday Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies He made the same appeal in St Paul Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer we would be the safest country in the world Watts said Instead we have a times higher gun homicide rate than any other highincome country Its time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nations gun laws Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups including Moms Demand Action It was really quite amazing the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress and we are Bloomberg said But then we know that people were killed a few days ago six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue and our hearts really have to go out to all of them In voicing support for stronger gun measures Bloomberg said Nobodys trying to take away anybodys guns We should have reasonable background checks Bloomberg added And dont sell guns to minors Dont sell guns to people with psychiatric problems Dont sell guns to people that have criminal records Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue because the federal government is just hopeless His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings a position embraced by the National Rifle Association CLARIFICATION This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks,bloomberg criticizes trump after pittsburgh shooting says he does not remember feeling the same passion in each of his four years there As a young man I remember what it felt like to be an American soldier But when youre gone its a different story I have great

conservative Democrat who often walks a tightrope between the national partys platform and appealing to conservative voters back home is staunchly tethering his campaign to the issue he views most at stake for West Virginians healthcare In a shift in tone from his campaign during which he opted for a narrative that distanced his campaign from Washington Democrats and Obamas signature piece of legislation it appears as though Manchin is now not only embracing the health law but also actively protecting it from his opponent Im more concerned right now about preexisting conditions Im more concerned about West Virginians losing their ability to have insurance or buy insurance because theyve been sick Somethings wrong here weve gotta change that Manchin told ABC News in June In toeing

The Trump administrations expected plan to transfer the licensing of gun exports from the State Department to the Commerce Department has Democratic lawmakers and foreign policy advocates readying for a fight The proposal under review by the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs OIRA has yet to be made public but experts fear it will lead to less oversight of commercial sales of assault weapons like submachine guns and flame throwers to foreign buyers ADVERTISEMENT Less oversight they warn could make it easier for deadly weapons to end up in the hands of terrorists and drug cartels Its a major change said Colby Goodman director of the Security Assistance Monitor program at the Center for International Policy Its opening up a lot more risk and a lot more opportunity for illegal and illicit trafficking The State Department said it is shifting responsibility to Commerce for approving exports of nonmilitary firearms and ammunition that are already commercially available those under Categories I II and III on the US Munitions List The goal is to reduce regulatory burdens on manufacturers and exporters Under the proposed rules an administration official told The Hill firearms and related articles that are uniquely military or that are not otherwise widely available for commercial sale would remain under State Department export licensing controls In shifting oversight exporters and manufacturers including small gunsmiths would no longer have to register with the State Departments Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and pay the annual registration fee But experts say if exporters arent forced to register with the federal government there will be no way to track and no one to prosecute when weapons end up in the wrong hands There are plenty of cases when in regular processes weapons have been lost said Jeff Abramson a nonresident senior fellow at the Arms Control Association adding that these are the weapons often used in human rights abuses Democrats are particularly upset with one potential change in the proposal Shifting oversight from the State Department to the Commerce Department they say would eliminate congressional review thats now required under the Arms Export Control Act for any commercial sales of lethal weapons worth million or more As you are aware combat firearms and ammunition are uniquely lethal they are easily spread and easily modified and are the primary means of injury death and destruction in civil and military conflicts throughout the world Sens Ben Cardin Benjamin Ben Louis CardinCongress eyes tighter

Department has a very different role than the State Department which leads on foreign affairs Commerces interest is selling USmade goods she said They arent looking at things from a public safety point of view Torres said the types of weapons being sold could cause a lot of problems in countries where democracy is fragile The State Department has more knowledge about whats happening on the ground she said The administration however disagrees The Commerce Department is uniquely qualified to handle these rule changes the administration official said in an email to The Hill In fact the Department of Commerce has decades of experience in licensing firearms for export under the Export Administration Regulations This involves the export reexport and transfer incountry of gauge shotguns optical sighting devices for firearms and crime control equipment The official said each export license would go through a rigorous interagency review process that includes the Defense and State departments to ensure national security and human rights concerns are addressed The proposed changes will allow the Commerce Department to use its expertise and resources through its inagency law enforcement unit and its robust end use verification program the official said This transfer will not create opportunities to put weapons in the hands of bad actors Gun manufacturers and former Obama administration officials say the hysteria over the rule is overblown and premature The rule after all has been in the works since and is expected to mimic an Obamaera proposal that was slated for release but stalled after children and six adults were killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Conn Kevin Wolf the former assistant secretary of Commerce for export administration said gun rights and gun control groups should relax until theyve seen the actual wording of the rule Everybody just chill he said Anyone who has any concerns should just relax until they see an actual rule to comment on Larry Keane senior vice president for government and public affairs and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation said hes been told the current rule isnt significantly or materially different than the Obamaera proposal It is disingenuous for people like Sen Cardin and other Democrats to now complain about the policy when the rules were over at the Office of Management and Budget and within hours of being published under Obama he said A former administration official familiar with the rule discussions said export licenses still would have been required for assault weapons under the Obamaera rule Licensing requirements would have been eased however for the less sensitive gun parts like screws and springs The assumption is the Commerce Department is less restrictive but the difference is less sensitive items can be treated less sensitively but more lethal items can be treated more aggressively the former official said The push to change the rules is supported by the National Rifle Association which says many people who never intend to export a firearm or firearm accessories like gunsmiths and parts manufacturers are now required to register with the State Department and pay high fees to operate their business The NRA supports the Trump administrations efforts to complete the reforms and transfer lawabiding firearms and ammunition manufacturers from an export system designed for nuclear submarines and ballistic missiles into one designed around lawful commercial products said NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker The State Departments proposed rule was sent to OIRA on Sept and is marked as pending review The office has days to review the rule but that deadline can be extended indefinitely by the head of the

If we as a society have determined that a person with serious psychological issues should not have possession of a firearm then we cannot make a distinction or a different decision simply based on their employment A police officer with mental health problems is no different than a civilian with a legal right to own and possess firearms with the same mental issues As an NRA member I believe in the Second Amendment our right to keep and bear arms and to be a responsible gun owner but I also believe that anyone with mental health issues serious enough to require hospitalization should not have possession of a firearm until such a time that they are cleared by a panel of qualified independent doctors regardless of whether they are a sworn law enforcement officer or not Out of fear of permanently losing their right to keep and bear arms many gun owners with mental issues or psychological problems do not seek the help they desperately need,carrying a gun is a privilege regardless of whether youre a civilian or a police officer chicago tribune the ultimate lawabiding and moral lawabiding citizen Even if I were the mayor Id be happy to fight against what I believe is the best and most effective lawabiding and moral lawabiding group in the country The people of Chicago stand up and make life better for their citizens in a way that every lawabiding adult should enjoy No one,a gun shop in chicago His friend told a reporter that he had had the gun while out buying guns on his way to school He shot a bunch of them with a loaded gun but I didnt hit them with it Im sure they got all this stuff said Joe who lives in north suburban Park Avenue according to Chicago Police Published Thursday Sept I think its going to be a very,0
When Sabika Aziz Sheikhs parents sent her to the United States as an exchange student from their native Pakistan in August they saw the opportunity as a step forward in her pursuit of a career in business They never envisioned those dreams ending at the hands of a gunman in her school and now they want other parents to avoid the immeasurable sorrow they continue to experience Sheikh was one of people eight students and two teachers killed in the May shooting at Santa Fe High School outside Houston On Wednesday her parents Abdul Aziz and Farah Naz joined six other families in a lawsuit against the parents of suspected shooter Dimitrios Pagourtzis Sheikh was less than three weeks away from completing her exchange program and returning home to Karachi when she became one of the victims in the nations seconddeadliest school shooting this year No other parent should ever have to experience this unbearable grief Sheikhs parents said in a statement Sabikas picture is in front of our eyes every single moment and her voice and laughter echo in our ears For a mother and a father this trauma and mourning stay until their last breath The lawsuit alleges that Antonio Pagourtzis and his wife Rose Marie Kosmetatos were negligent in storing the weapons their son used to carry out the massacre and ignored signs that he might harm himself or others Dimitrios Pagourtzis who was then and a junior at the school has been charged with capital murder and aggravated assault on a peace officer He admitted to the shooting spree after being arrested In addition to pursuing more than million in damages Aziz and Naz see the lawsuit as a way to shed light on the gun culture in the United States their lawyer said They had no knowledge of that before Sabika was killed Molly ThomasJensen said Its part of a broader conversation that the US has an anomalous problem with gun violence ThomasJensen works as counsel for Everytown for Gun Safety a guncontrol advocacy group that is providing part of the legal representation for the AzizNaz family while highlighting the issue of safe storage of firearms MoreDad says Santa Fe shooting suspect was bullied school rejects claim MoreSchool shootings and mental health Inside the minds of mass shooters The organization has helped defend gunstorage ordinances against legal challenges by the NRA in two cities in Washington State including Seattle Authorities have said Dimitrios Pagourtzis used his fathers legallyowned shotgun and revolver in his shooting rampage and also brought explosive devices that did not detonate to the school It is not clear how the weapons were stored Antonios Pagourtzis reportedly told Greek station Antenna TV that his son took them from his closet but neither the elder Pagourtzis nor his wife has been charged Texas law says guns cant be made accessible to children under with certain exceptions However Dimitrios Pagourtzis was already at the time of the attack Defense lawyer Ron Rodgers who represents the elder Pagourtzis and Kosmetatos told USA TODAY via email that his clients are heartbroken over the tragedy While it is perhaps natural for those looking for someone to blame for the acts of a child to point the finger at the parents the fact is that many of the allegations concerning my clients are either inaccurate or wholly untrue Rodgers wrote The allegation that my clients were negligent in storing their weapons is not supported by the evidence The claim that the guns were taken from the closet is entirely false They were kept in a locked gun cabinet At this point I can only surmise that this allegation was based on inaccurate translation There are other statements attributed to Mr Pagourtzis in his interview with Greek media that were translated incorrectly The lawsuit charges the parents not only failed to secure the weapons but also neglected to take action even though their son harbored violent and hateful impulses The list of examples cited in the complaint include a fascination with the Columbine school killings of and a habit of dressing like the shooters the keen interest in firearms Dimitrios Pagourtzis demonstrated on social media and his uploading to his Facebook page of a photo with a Tshirt bearing the words BORN TO KILL Eric Tirschwell litigation director for Everytown for Gun Safety said the signs were strong enough for Pagourtzis parents to at least make sure he could not access the weapons If you make the decision to have firearms in your home you have a responsibility to make sure they are secure and in particularly in a situation where you have a household member a child or otherwise who is exhibiting behavior that would cause any reasonable person to be alarmed Tirschwell said,unbearable grief pakistani parents of

Do Gun Control Laws Save Lives Major Study Says Lack Of Federal Funding For Research Means We Still Dont Know By Chantal Da Silva On at AM Does gun control save lives One of the largestever studies on US gun policy published on Friday found some evidence that a number of policies could reduce homicides suicides and accidental deaths and injuries However the think tank behind the study said there has been so little research done on the subject due to a lack of federal funding that it will be difficult for policymakers to make informed decisions In a research project called Gun Policy in America The RAND Corp think tank sought to provide a factual basis for the debate around gun control to determine which policies might be the most effective In reviewing available research however RAND said it found a lack of studies attributing a reduction in violence rather than just coinciding with the results The project looked at thousands of studies but only of them had causal results about gun policies with only twothirds of them were carried out in the last years Still the RAND team determined that the strongest evidence available supports the conclusion that laws designed to keep guns out of the hands of children reduce selfinjuries related to firearms suicides and accidental injuries to children It also found moderate evidence to support conclusions that background checks reduce firearm suicides and firearm homicides and that laws prohibiting the purchase or possession of guns by individuals affected by mental health issues reduce violent crime The think tank said there is also moderate evidence that standyourground laws which allow people to use guns to defend themselves without being required to at first attempt to flee when possible may increase state homicide rates For four of the outcomes we studieddefensive gun use hunting and recreation mass shootings and officerinvolved shootingswe found inconclusive evidence at best on the effects of any of the policies researchers said However these understudied outcomes are often central concerns in gun policy debates For instance even though we found that childaccess prevention laws have measureable benefits in reducing accidental and intentional selfinjuries and deaths the effects of these laws on defensive gun useone of the principal objections raised against childaccess prevention lawshave not been evaluated rigorously they added RAND said the lack of information on gun control could in large part be attributed to a lack of federal funding for research which it said dried up around years ago In fact annual spending bills in Congress since say no funding at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC may be used to advocate or promote gun control The federal government previously supported a more robust program of research examining firearm violence and policy RAND researchers explained In the s the CDC was sponsoring millions of dollars of research on firearm violence But when a group of researchers found that having a gun in the home was associated with an elevated risk of firearm homicide for members of the household their results were viewed by some as a onesided attempt to manipulate the gun policy debate they added As a result Congress passed the Dickey Amendment in which slashed million of funding from the CDCan amount that mirrored what its injury prevention center had been investing in gun violence research RAND The think tank recommended the federal government increase funding for gun research to levels more on par with federal research investments in research into other significant causes of death and injury such as car accidents The think tank also said the focus of federally funded research should be expanded to look at the effects policies have on defensive gun use gun ownership hunting and recreation activities jobs in the gun industry and officerinvolved shootings Read more Gun Control Laws These Are the Measures Americans Support Unfortunately federal support for research that could help states and communities reduce firearm crime violence and suicide remains very limited researchers said Moreover the state and federal surveys describing gun ownership and usesorely needed to help researchers understand how statelevel policies workhave not lived up to the optimism expressed by researchers in the early s they said adding In some important respects federal support has deteriorated since then RANDs research project comes in the wake of last months school shooting in Parkland Florida that saw students and teachers killed Don Juan MooreGetty The study comes in the wake of last months school shooting in Parkland Florida which saw students and teachers killed The mass shooting reignited the nationwide

teachers feign complete confidence strategically managing to keep their beloved young students utterly silent while the clock ticks Last week my husband took our son to a football game and after our alma mater scored their first touchdown they highfived each other and hugged in celebration When the fireworks went off instead of marveling at the spectacle our son began crying in terror that there was an active shooter AD Those were his words Hes Children especially those younger than should not be expected to continue simulating the problem of school shootings by frequently participating in stressful lockdown drills that have not been demonstrated effective can traumatize them and potentially impact their education and health outcomes AD While our children and their teachers are usually aware when a lockdown is a drill or just pretend their brains do not sending their nervous systems into fight flight or freeze Except they can only do one thing freeze In the shortterm their bodies are overwhelmed with adrenaline and cortisol This type of unpredictable stress activates inflammatory responses in the body that have been shown to cause depression For children who also might be suffering from food insecurity andor fewer opportunities for physical activity their ability to fight illness is compromised AD Longterm children are at greater risk for developing chronic illness as adults and if they experience a lifethreatening trauma posttraumatic stress disorder Childhood stress is also linked to lower IQ scores and academic achievement Couple these risk factors with few or no healthy opportunities to manage stress and lockdown drills are a recipe for disaster for our children AD While lockdown drills provide practical value they are not always effective and have actually been used to inform shooters tactical strategies Our government needs to treat gun violence like the public health crisis that it is Schools need the resources to substitute burdening children and communities with lockdown drills with positive behavioral interventions and support for parents and staff instead And students need opportunities to release stress hormones immediately after drills AD Lets equip caregivers and educators with ways to nurture each child to realize their greatness influencing all children in a positive way Lets train adults on how to identify assess and respond to threatening behaviors rather than distressing entire communities by repeatedly simulating the problem It would be an investment in our schools and the future of every child AD Such strengths and evidencebased personalized approaches might actually prompt our children to learn and be carefree at school the way it should be instead of forcing entire generations to hide in silence,mom thanks to activeshooter drills at school my yearold thought fireworks were gunshots enough already But then suddenly another man ran into the cafeteria fired the ball into school and shot to death everyone who opened it to his parents What will these kids be able to do for a very long time to come if the government continues to try to keep those young Americans back in the future Because this weeks attack is one more example of,heidi l pottinger director of clinical investigations in the department of health prom sciences at the university of arizona college of public health

In this Sept photo the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino reflects the last sunlight of the day along the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas The hotel was the scene of the the worst mass shooting in modern US history when a gunman killed people at a country music festival in AP PhotoJohn Locher LAS VEGAS AP A small bouquet of dried flowers was wedged inside the padlock on Gate of the killing ground that was the Route Harvest Festival one recent day the only visible reminder that it was the site of the worst mass shooting in modern American history A peek inside the chainlink fence covered in green sheeting to keep out prying eyes revealed a sprawling patch of asphalt and little else Towering above were the gold windows of the Mandalay Bay where a gambler spent the last minutes of his life in room taking the lives of others in a meticulously planned slaughter Around Las Vegas there are scattered remembrances of the horrors of that night a year ago Almost every week theres another courtordered release of police bodycamera videos that provide flashbacks to the night the gunman turned the fun of the glittering Las Vegas Strip into a nightmare of death and despair And lawsuits by MGM Resorts International to force survivors to give up their right to sue the casino company that owns Mandalay Bay opened fresh wounds over the summer But the Vegas Strong Tshirts and car stickers have largely been put away The original handmade white crosses for each victim have long since been taken away from the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign to eventually reside in a museum in neighboring Henderson though some new ones were brought in for the anniversary There has been no closure at least officially Authorities say they will likely never be able to determine what it was that turned a highlimit video poker player into a mass murderer But in a city that has always looked ahead relentlessly theres not a lot of time devoted to reflection Even while pausing to remember the victims on the anniversary of the shooting Las Vegas moves forward A lot of the feeling among people is more Lets move on said Pauline Ng Lee a community activist and chairwoman of the Nevada Republican Mens Club We dont have a lot of long traditions here You can see it with buildings Casinos come up casinos get knocked down People tend to look forward not back Indeed a look out one side of the high windows of the Mandalay Bay shows the normal sight of dozens of tourists lined up to have their pictures taken in front of the Welcome to Las Vegas sign A glance to the left draws the eye to the vacated and somber site of the shooting on acres of valuable Las Vegas Strip land that for the foreseeable future simply cannot be used for anything Owner MGM Resorts International has no plans for the venue and no timeline for making any decisions Meanwhile on the other side of the hotel work goes on around the clock on a new billion stadium that will be the home of the NFLs Las Vegas Raiders beginning in Its a reminder that Las Vegas moves on like it always has through the good times and the bad Its not that the city has forgotten the shooting or the victims The white crosses adorned with pictures of those killed were moved recently for the anniversary to the rotunda of the Clark County government building accompanying a heartwrenching display of paintings of each person The victims are portrayed as surviving relatives wanted them to be One young woman is wearing a Philadelphia Eagles jersey a man is strumming a guitar Theres a police officer in his uniform and a man

citizens but focusing on making sure that citizens who shouldnt get guns in the first place dont get those guns Ryan who said arming teachers was a good idea but a local issue that Congress should not infringe upon touted a Housepassed bill to reinforce background checks under current law But that bill also loosens gun laws by allowing gun owners with concealedcarry weapons permits in their state

Discuss Gun Control Policy Right After Vegas Shooting by HuffPosts Daniel Marans The morning after the Oct mass shooting in Las Vegas a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committees press staff warned House candidates and their staffs not to politicize the shooting that day Politicization according to the DCCC official included talking about gun violence prevention policy Meredith Kelly the DCCCs communications director emphasized that DCCC staffer Evan Lukaskes message was intended to discourage hasty responses before all information about the shooting was known rather than silence opinions about gun policy It was also general advice that candidates were free to ignore The DCCC would not say whether it sent candidates similar guidance after the Parkland shooting However

The debate over gun control and how to stop school shootings ramped into high gear this week days after the shooting in Parkland Florida that left people dead Proponents of tighter gun laws including many survivors of the shooting itself have begun campaigns to pressure lawmakers and cut support for the National Rifle Association President Trump meanwhile has proposed arming teachers and training them to confront wouldbe school shooters To get some perspective on the debate we turned to those who have been directly affected by gun violence Our panel included Austin Eubanks a survivor of the Columbine school shooting Nicole Hockley mother of Dylan who killed in the Newtown school shooting cofounder of Sandy Hook Promise Andy Parker father of slain journalist Alison Parker cofounder of the For Alison Foundation Michele Gay mother of Josephine who was killed in the Newtown school shooting cofounder of Safe and Sound Schools John Mina Orlando police chief during the Pulse nightclub shooting member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police The following is a transcript of the interview with the panel that aired Sunday Feb on Face the Nation MARGARET BRENNAN We want to turn now to a group of people whose lives have been impacted directly by gun violence and who have been moved to do something about it Austin Eubanks was a yearold student at Columbine High School when two of his classmates opened fire in wounding him and killing He is now the Chief Operating Officer at Foundry Treatment Center and addiction recovery facility out in Colorado Nicole Hockleys son Dylan was among the children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Connecticut in December of She cofounded Sandy Hook Promise a group working to protect children from gun violence Andy Parkers daughter Alison was a reporter for CBS affiliate WDBJ in Roanoke Virginia when she was shot and killed during a live broadcast in And hes now an activist and he helped start For Alison an educational foundation named after his daughter And Michele Gay lost her daughter Josephine in the Sandy Hook massacre A former teacher she cofounded Safe and Sound Schools following her daughters death And joining us now is John Mina from Orlando He is the chief of police for the Orlando Police Department a job he held back in June when a gunman entered Pulse Nightclub and killed people Nicole I want to start with you After Sandy Hook people said this has to be different This was an attack on children People now are saying that about Parkland It feels different politically do you think it is NICOLE HOCKLEY I do I do feel the difference because I think theres a difference between adults advocating for their children versus children advocating for themselves And these are articulate teenagers sharing their experience and demanding that the adults listen to them So I think the politicians need to stop their nonsense fighting and instead just kind of shut up and listen a little bit to these kids and listen to what theyre demanding because this cant continue we cant keep letting our kids die and feel unsafe in their schools MARGARET BRENNAN And you met with a number of these activists in Florida NICOLE HOCKLEY I did meet with some of them and their energy and their drive that energized me because you know Ive been in this fight for five years theyre at the start of a very long journey But they have tools in terms of social media and stuff that I didnt really have at my fingertips They are organizing and mobilizing at an incredibly rapid rate and and theyre not listening to what other people are telling them to say theyre speaking for themselves Theyre being authentic And I think that has power MARGARET BRENNAN Michele do you see that student activism in the same way MICHELE GAY I do And interestingly enough in in the school safety space when we founded Safe and Sound Schools in the spring following the tragedy the first and probably most powerful group that we were hearing from was was students So weve been working with students now for five years We just released a youth council program that came out this fall So were grateful that a lot of those councils were already established prior to this tragedy and that the kids have this platform to speak in their communities But I would agree with Nicole It is it is different this time because because they are organized because they are speaking up and we want to hear what they have to say MARGARET BRENNAN Andy after your daughters death you became politically active so did Alisons fiance Where do you think that this activism should be focused Is it at the local and state level or is it here in Washington ANDY PARKER Margaret it has to be all of the above And we have to give law enforcement the tools that they need to prevent this kind of tragedy from happening And one of them ironically Marco Rubio brought it up in the town hall last week is a gun violence restraining order And you know what a lot of people dont know is that with all the the alarms and the red flags and the warnings about this shooter in Florida he was never he was never arrested for anything So legally law enforcement cant go in and remove weapons And what the GVRO or the gun violence restraining order they can I hope that this changes the equation because Barbara and I testified in front of a Virginia senate committee on this very issue The chairman of the committee looked at me and said Were sorry for your loss And then they voted it down on party lines Same thing with a a young woman who survived the Las Vegas shooting was in tears saying Please ban bump stocks They did the same thing to her So you know at this point the Republican Party hopefully there will be a change there but theyre the party of the NRA I mean thats just the fact MARGARET BRENNAN Austin what you lived through happened in the middle of an assault weapons ban despite it So when you hear these activists these student activists in particular call for a ban on specifically that does that speak to you in any way Do you say thats misguided or how do you think this should be focused AUSTIN EUBANKS Well it definitely speaks to me and Im really inspired by the level of activism that Ive seen The problem that I have is I think that we get so laser focused on either one of two sides its either gun control or mental health and then nothing ever gets done So I think that we do have a problem with accessibility to these weapons but specifically I think we have a problem to accessibility to high capacity magazines We have to bring down the number of shots that somebody can fire before reloading and I think thats exceptionally important Beyond that we have to look at why this issue is occurring and we have to go all the way back to the way that were educating and socializing young men And so what I really advocate for is appointing a nonpartisan group of experts who can study this issue comprehensively and in the near term we have to bring down the loss of life And by doing that we can eliminate high capacity magazines and assault weapons MARGARET BRENNAN At the federal or local level AUSTIN EUBANKS I believe at the federal level MARGARET BRENNAN You do Chief Mina not want to come to you Quickly before we go to commercial break and then continue our conversation on the other side of it but Chief it sounds like there were just so many red flags at least calls to local authorities Flags raised to the FBI in this case and Parkland How hard is it to actually intervene as law enforcement I mean is this a matter of just local bureaucracy run amok or is it a failure a dereliction of duty How do people understand this CHIEF JOHN MINA Well it is definitely a failure of all the systems involved You know at the Orlando Police Department I know many of our law enforcement agencies in central Florida across the nation There are protocols in place for when we receive social media threats for when we get some of these red flags And I would tell you that you know we dont stop working until that threat is mitigated until we it you identify the person who made that threat Go talk to them talk to their parents and go really hands on with them And in many cases either arrest or commit that person for an involuntary mental examination the issue and some of the problems with that is even if we commit someone under the Baker Act for a mental evaluation they can get their evaluation and probably be released in less than hours and still go in and able to buy a firearm so that that loophole needs to be closed because many of our law enforcement throughout the country have had many success stories as far as mitigating some of these threats and seeing the red flags and working until the very end putting the person in custody or getting them evaluated and then and then that person is still being able to purchase a firearm MARGARET BRENNAN Chief we want to talk to you again on the other side of this break along with the rest of our panel so stay with us please Well be back in just a moment COMMERCIAL BREAK MARGARET BRENNAN Were back with our panel on gun violence I want to go to Orlando and bring in Chief Mina who was chief in that city during the Pulse Nightclub attack which did involve the shooter using a semi automatic weapon Chief I want to ask you this proposal to at the state level have skilled teachers be armed to you Does that make a difference CHIEF JOHN MINA Oh I dont think thats a good idea Our teachers are already have many responsibilities Its their job to educate our students and they do a great job of that Our teachers arent trained physically or mentally prepared to handle firearms in a stressful situation Law enforcement throughout the country not only did they get through you know hours and months and weeks of training but they also carry firearms every day and deal and use their firearms And sometimes in stressful situations and for a teacher to be educating students at one second and then be responsible for responding in a high stress situation with a firearm with not enough training or mental preparation I dont think its a good fit Im definitely against that MARGARET BRENNAN Michele you are a formerformer teacher What do you think about arming educators MICHELE GAYI would agree completely I I just I understand that its a community based decision and that will always be our position that Safe and Sound Schools We know that different communities are made up of different people with different backgrounds and there are different circumstances Some of our school communities are facing you know response times that that may be up to minutes so I understand the need to look at all solutions put them all on the table But when I think very practically about myself sitting in a second grade classroom on the floor criss cross applesauce with with my students teaching reading The last thing I would be ready for in the split second that it might happen is is having to pull out a firearm and pull it from my hip and intervene in that way and further having worked with School Resource Officers so closely for the past five years we know the level of training that they undergo We know the time the mindset as the other guest is talking about just just the familiarity of having that firearm with you and all of that working consideration that goes into that Thats not something I want to put on a teacher who is already very overburdened sadly with a lot of tremendous responsibilities MARGARET BRENNAN Austin Colorado has explored this What do you think AUSTIN EUBANKS So Im opposed to it as well but I do believe that we have to strengthen schools by way of architecture metal detectors or perhaps additional security personnel But I do think that those two functions have to be completely separate Educators have to focus on education and security officials need to focus on security MARGARET BRENNAN Nicole with Sandy Hook Promise youve been looking at ways to harden the response at least What are you looking at proposing NICOLE HOCKLEY Well I agree that we need to focus on how do we handle imminent danger such as school security and the infrastructure of our schools But I do believe that the shift needs to focus more to prevention How do we help identify people that are at risk of potentially hurting themselves or others Thats what we offer from Sandy Hook Promise and about seven thousand schools at the moment with our free programs and our free anonymous reporting system This is a way for teachers educators students and parents to say this is what Im recognizing and this is what Im seeing and then have a system to report it and to be honest in terms of arming teachers it would be better to arm them with this knowledge and the ability to do that to prevent violence before it happens and if theres federal funding available for these programs versus arming teachers I would put it towards the programs or you know giving teachers more what they need in terms of supplies or books or arming them with more school counselors as well to help these kids MARGARET BRENNAN Andy Im going to ask you you personally faced some backlash for your activism and something were seeing now with these students in Florida Where does that come from ANDY PARKER There are a legion of hoaxers that descend on they descended on me like locusts Theyve done the same thing with the kids in Florida They call it crisis actors They say Alison is has had plastic surgery and is living in Israel someplace You know the level of cruelty is just unimaginable But you know its fuelled if you do all you have to do is look up the street on Pennsylvania Avenue Its enabled by a president that has unhinged tweets every single day Arming teachers and so hes enabling this kind hes helping create the sort of atmosphere that that brings upon these people MARGARET BRENNAN What did you think of the presidents

Immediately after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland Florida Wednesday our elected officials tweeted and posted the usual thoughts and prayers rhetoric to shut down conversations about why such terrifying events occur with such frequency Less than a day later President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump says he would be comfortable sending son grandchildren to school in person Cafeteria worker on White House grounds tests positive for COVID reports Republicans to start unveiling coronavirus package Thursday MORE spoke about violence hatred and evil and vowed to prioritize school safety but avoided any mention of firearms Sen Marco Rubio Marco Antonio RubioRepublicans to start unveiling coronavirus package Thursday Trump ramps up China tensions with consulate shutdown Rubio mistakenly tweets tribute to Lewis with picture of late Elijah Cummings MORE RFla opined mere hours afterwards that other discussions are premature since people dont know how this happened echoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison Mitch Mitchell McConnellRepublicans to start unveiling coronavirus package Thursday GOP may face choice on tax cut or stimulus checks Hillicon Valley Twitter bans thousands of QAnon accounts Bipartisan support grows for election funds in Senate stimulus bill Senate committee advances bill to ban TikTok from federal devices MOREs RKy remarks immediately following the Route Harvest Festival massacre in Las Vegas I think its particularly inappropriate to politicize an event like this It just happened in the last day and a half But Trump Rubio and McConnell are dead wrong Not forcing these conversations is quite literally a fatal mistake ADVERTISEMENT Discussing gun violence has become so poisonous and polarizing that it exerts a strong impact on our everyday lives and personal relationships Some Americans who have firearms safely stored in their home wont bring this topic up lest others think they are Second Amendment zealots with a basement bunker stocked for a coming ammopocalypse Others dont mention the Gword lest they be accused of being a libtard This isnt healthy not confronting the reality that kids get shot when they play with unsecured firearms makes such accidents sure to happen In more public contexts our historical reluctance to force these conversations has made it more difficult to start them in the first place Its hard to have educated and informed exchanges thanks to the Dickey Amendment a provision inserted into a federal spending bill mandating that no funds allocated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC can be used to advocate or promote gun control enacting a de facto ban on gun violence research resources the lack of which we literally die for Our unwillingness to talk about guns and gun violence has even made it easy for states to make such discourse downright unlawful Indiana state law for example bars public and private employers from asking employees about whether they own use or transport a gun with no public safety exception If they do they can be slapped with a civil suit for economic damages court costs and even punitive damages While this law might make gun owners more comfortable it puts others at risk by preventing employers from adequately protecting other employees from atrisk colleagues If Bob in marketing is suicidal or threatens Mary down in sales then Bobs boss is in a really tough position and might hesitate to ask Bob whether he has a firearm readily at hand in his car trunk in the parking lot And that hesitation might be fatal Such restrictions are particularly mystifying when the law affirmatively protects the right to discuss gun ownership access and safety even though such conversations can be discomfiting In Wollschlauger v Governor of Florida the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit declared unconstitutional a Florida law that ostensibly protected patient privacy by prohibiting physicians from asking patients about their ownership and use of firearms That law the court held violated physicians First Amendment rights interfering with professional standards that require them to ask and educate about firearm ownership Patients who were uncomfortable with such questions could refuse to answer and such topics were certainly not the only difficult discussions to emerge in doctorpatient conversations Our growing reluctance to talk about firearms and firearm violence doesnt respect the Second Amendment it turns it into a club used to bully others into silence and submission This is the opposite of what the Second Amendment is intended to be the constitutional provision that as Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia put it in District of Columbia v Heller has protected the rights of lawabiding responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home Using the Second Amendment as a silencer bastardizes it undermining the civil discourse essential to democracy creating and reinforcing a flawed narrative that fundamentally changes what people think gun ownership is about and warps popular understandings of the Second Amendment Thats how we come to believe that shall not infringe means literally that no firearms regulations are permissible equate gun safety education to gungrabbing schemes and misconstrue even proSecond Amendment Supreme Court cases as unconstitutional judicial activism all dangerous misconceptions that perpetuate and strengthen the politicization of Second Amendment issues and mass shootings The first step in preventing gun violence from domestic assaults with firearms to school shootings like Newtown and Parkland with high body counts is to talk about them in meaningful ways that go beyond thoughts and prayers and Facebook posts to engagement and research Without these resources Second Amendment advocates and opponents wont find common ground and the majority of us who are caught in the middle cant learn from these exchanges These conversations might get messy uncomfortable emotional and downright infuriating but have them we must As the Eleventh Circuit emphasized in Wollschlaeger many are those who must endure speech they do

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports The news and stories that matter delivered weekday mornings A day after a competitive video gamer shot and killed two people wounding others at a Madden video game tournament in Jacksonville Florida a group of farright news outlets announced that they had found the Reddit account used by the shooter who they said used the pseudonym Ravenchamps But the groups were wrong Ravenchamps did not belong to the shooter who the police say was a Baltimore resident named David Katz and who killed himself in the shooting And the announcement caused considerable trouble for the real person who owned the account The fringe sites Infowars and Gateway Pundit plus farright commentator Mike Cernovich and reporter Ian Miles Cheong claimed that Ravenchamps similar to Katzs frequent video game username Ravenschamps was operated by the alleged shooter before his death They pointed to the accounts rhetoric that repeatedly slammed the president along with other political figures pointing out a comment where Ravenchamps called users Trumptards But the real owner of the account was a Minnesota native named Pavel who returned to Reddit on Monday to see dozens of people claiming he was dead I went on Reddit I noticed I had unread messages Usually I have two or something Pavel who didnt give his last name out of privacy concerns told NBC News on Monday night I look at the messages and its a bunch of people using my username claiming Im that Madden shooter person Half of them are messages like I hope that persons dead Responding to a user who said ravenchamps was his profile see for yourself Ravenchamps wrote back Im alive you know he wrote Pavel then went to Reddits AskMeAnything board to answer questions about everything from his favorite TV show to what it was like to have all of his old opinions shared across the web as a possible motive of a mass shooting Confused at first now Im just laughing about it he wrote Shortly after Pavel started tweeting Gateway Pundit appended two question marks to the headline of their story tying him to the shooting which now reads Jacksonville Shooter Was Member of AntiTrump Resistance Murdered People UPDATE This is not the first time Gateway Pundit has misidentified someone who committed an attack or mass shooting The site said the Charlottesville car attack was conducted by an antiTrump protester who in reality was hundreds of miles away at the time of the attack The site also named the wrong person in the Las Vegas mass shooting and spun an elaborate conspiracy based on an anonymous Twitter post which identified the wrong person in a mass shooting at the airport in Ft Lauderdale Florida in January Cernovich an early promoter of the pizzagate conspiracy theory who has been touring Arizona with Republican Senate candidate Kelli Ward was cited in the Gateway Pundit article saying Katz was a member of the Resistance pointing to Pavels Reddit account Cernovich has since apologized adding The mass shooters Reddit handle is different from one that previously circulated Infowars a purveyor of conspiracy theories that was recently banned from Facebook and YouTube blasted Jacksonville Madden Shooter Criticized Trumptards on Reddit in their headline and claimed he hated Trump supporters Pavel who is mostly on Reddit to talk about football and video games said he came home from some errands after his factory job on Monday night to learn that all of his comments had been pored over by fringe websites and fellow Reddit users He praised some users for their good detective work identifying the Minnesota plates on a picture of his Mazda which he uploaded to a car subreddit years ago Some people really dug in there he said I was like You guys are really interested in me Pavel whose identity NBC News was independently able to confirm through a phone records search said it was the weirdest Monday internetwise hes ever had and he was going to spend the rest of the night making some mixies and calling out some idiots When he refreshed his browser he had more messages to respond to since the start of the phone call My takeaway on this is there are a

On Jan three weeks into the spring semester a yearold sophomore named Gabe Parker brought his stepfathers millimeter Ruger handgun to Marshall County High School in Western Kentucky opened fire on the more than students who were milling about the main common area waiting for the morning bell to ring then dropped his weapon near the auditorium and disappeared into the chaos he had created Teachers were the first responders Before police officers and medics arrived they gathered sobbing vomiting bleeding kids into the safest rooms they could find then locked the doors and kept vigil with them through the stunned and terrified wait They shepherded the injured to hospitals in their own cars And they knelt on the ground with the ones who were too wounded to move stanching blood flow with their own hands and providing whatever comfort and assurance they could muster For the history teacher Erin Mathis those few minutes passed like hours She was not in the commons during the shooting but when the health teacher screamed that students had been shot she and a few others found themselves running toward where the sound of bullets had been heard Mathis whose only medical experience consisted of candystriping as a preteen prayed as she ran God you are going to have to do this Because I cannot Superintendent Trent Lovett was just walking into his office a short distance from the high school when Principal Patricia Greer called to tell him that at least one student was down He jumped back in his truck and raced up the access road that connected the two buildings calling his own freshman daughter along the way to make sure she was safe When he arrived he saw that several students had been shot and that each of them was being attended to by at least one faculty or staff member They had no clue where the shooter was or if he was coming back Lovett thought And they didnt know if there were other shooters or bombs or other weapons in the offing Hadnt some mass shooters rigged their targets in advance with explosives Police and ambulance were on their way his own daughter was safe and the students who werent wounded had either fled or were hiding with other educators So Lovett did the next thing he could think to do He grabbed an aluminum bat from an abandoned bag of sports equipment and went looking for the teenage boy with the gun Parker had slipped into the weight room where Rob McDonald a gym teacher and baseball coach was keeping watch over or so other frantic students whom he had managed to shelter from the panic Two of those students had been shot Two others approached McDonald and in a whisper informed him that the shooter was among them While his teachers aide went to call a school administrator McDonald moved across the room as discreetly as possible positioned himself right behind the boy in question and braced himself for trouble If he moves McDonald thought Ill floor him Parkers hands were tucked into his coat pockets It was a winter coat and McDonald could not tell if it contained a gun He thought briefly about what he might do if he could reach his own gun which was in the glove box of his car But the truth was he had no way of knowing if this was the right kid or not It seemed incredible to him that a boy would shoot up the school and then hide with his own victims He was still in doubt when police officers came to the weight room several minutes later and aimed their own weapons at the boy Not until he heard those cops ask Parker where the gun was and watched Parker answer calmly without denying anything did the truth finally sink in Superintendent Trent Lovett in jacket with teachers and faculty members from Marshall County High School Left to right Kelly Weaver Amy Cathey Cory Westerfield Rob M c Donald Patricia Greer and Erin Mathis Graeme Mitchell for The New York Times Lovett returned to the commons and took stock The floor was slicked with blood and spilled beverages and littered with abandoned backpacks Dozens of cellphones rang without pause One staff member was tending to Preston Cope a sophomore whose family Lovett knew well and who appeared to have been shot in the head Copes phone was ringing too and for a split second Lovett considered ignoring it The screen read Dad and Lovett was not practiced in delivering such news But he quickly thought better of that impulse remembering how desperate he had been for information after one of his own children was in an ultimately fatal car accident He answered the phone told Copes father that his son was not OK then issued a quick string of instructions Hurry Be safe Pray By then medics were starting to arrive and a tortured bureaucracy was being erected around the mayhem Lovett and Greer set up a system to field incoming calls and deployed staff members to each hospital that was receiving injured students In all students had been shot two of whom would die Preston Cope on the way to the hospital and Bailey Holt right there in the commons Holts parents were looking for her at the middle school where students were being bused and where parents were being told to go Lovett arranged for them to be taken to the meeting room in a nearby fire station and went with two officers to meet them there They shouldnt have to hear it in front of everyone he thought This time though he didnt have to say a word When the girls parents turned the corner and saw only Lovett waiting for them they knew their daughter was dead For all the fear they inspire school shootings of any kind are technically still quite rare Less than percent of all fatal shootings that involve children age to occur in school and a significant majority of those do not involve indiscriminate rampages or mass casualties It has been two decades since Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold ushered in the era of modern highprofile highcasualty shootings with their massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton Colo According to James Alan Fox a criminologist at Northeastern University just of the nations or so schools have experienced a similar calamity a school shooting with four or more victims and at least two deaths since then But those shootings have had an outsize effect on our collective psyche and its not difficult to understand why We are left with the specter of children being gunned down en masse in their own schools One such event would be enough to terrify and enrage us This year we had three Teachers are at the quiet center of this recurring national horror They are victims and ad hoc emergency workers often with close ties to both shooter and slain and with decadeslong connections to the school itself But they are also almost by definition anonymous public servants accustomed to placing their students needs above their own And as a result our picture of their suffering is incomplete Watch educators as they tell us in their own words about what its like to to teach in an era of school shootings We know that the trauma that teachers experience after a school shooting can be both severe and enduring Their PTSD can be as serious as what you see in soldiers says Robert Pynoos codirector of the federally funded National Center for Child Traumatic Stress which helps schools coordinate their responses to traumatic events But unlike soldiers none of them signed up for this and none of them have been trained to cope with it We know that teachers who were least able to protect their students in the moment tend to be especially traumatized For teachers the duty to educate students is primary Pynoos says But the urge to protect those students is deeper than that And we know that their symptoms can include major sleep disturbance hairtrigger startle responses and trouble regulating emotions Marshall County High school where a sophomore killed two of his classmates and wounded others in January Graeme Mitchell for The New York Times But we dont know much else Researchers have calculated the rates of PTSD for a host of other traumatic experiences estimating that it affects up to percent of combat soldiers and percent of rape survivors But we have no analogous statistics for educators who survive school shootings nor any sense of how such an experience not to mention its hyperpoliticized mediafrenzied aftermath might affect their ability to teach or their longterm career trajectories Those are important questions that really need further study Pynoos says In the meantime teachers who survived shootings are doing what they can to fill in the blanks themselves Paula Reed an English teacher who once taught Dylan Klebold and who retired from Columbine this spring says that she and her colleagues reach out to schools after every incident Columbine always calls she says to offer support and answer whatever questions they can The questions she says are always the same How long until I feel better Will I ever be able to teach again When will I get my old self back Reed tries to tell the teachers the things she wishes someone had told her starting with the fact that it takes years not weeks to recover Youd be surprised how many people dont get that she says Six weeks after Sandy Hook some parents and spouses were already asking why the teachers werent better yet For years she and a few others had these conversations through an informal network A shooting would make headlines and they would contact the school directly or teachers would come to them independently seeking perspective and guidance This year Reed created a private Facebook page specifically for fellow educatorsurvivors It has members so far This was my last year teaching Reed says And it was sadly filled with school shootings Four weeks after the Marshall County shooting a former student killed three educators and students and wounded others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Fla And three months after that another school shooter in Santa Fe Tex killed eight students and two teachers and injured others In the aftermath of those events politicians policymakers health officials and entrepreneurs have proffered a litany of solutions to what is now commonly thought of as the schoolshooting problem Among other things schools have been advised to teach teachers to use tourniquets ramp up activeshooter drills get rid of activeshooter drills ban backpacks make backpacks bulletproof teach teachers to teach compassion Forget compassion teach them to use guns Forget compassion and guns and teach them how to identify budding psychopaths before they blossom into murderers For the teachers themselves each demand brings its own implicit expectations and its own fresh roster of uncertainties Should they be prepared to take a bullet for their charges To shoot one student for the sake of protecting others Is it their job to prevent these things from happening in the first place Regular coursework was quasisuspended after the Marshall County shooting but the teachers still had lessons to impart Jenny Darnall and Kelly Weaver who taught English and history respectively wanted to make sure their students took stock of the kindness enveloping the school Look at the banners and letters and cards pouring in from across the country they told them Look at the comfort quilts and comfort dogs and comfort food See the fellowship in it And remember When the time comes you will do the same for others Cory Westerfield a teacher of algebra and German and the girls track coach was adamant that his students not live in fear forever When the starting pistol sent one of his star athletes into a panic right as she was preparing to do the triple jump he coaxed her onto the field gently but firmly Youre going to walk down there really really slowly he said pointing to the other side of the field And then walk back really really slowly Living in fear was not really living he told her It was just existing And he wanted them to do more than just exist Cory Westerfield a teacher of algebra and German and the girls track coach at Marshall County High School Graeme Mitchell for The New York Times The teachers were harder on themselves though They too had meltdowns in rushing crowds at airports when they were momentarily separated from their own children They sometimes berated themselves for these reactions aware that others around them had been through much worse Westerfield thought of Mathiss getting literal blood on her hands and felt ashamed of his own tears Mathis thought of other teachers who after the EMTs took the most severely injured away followed the trails of blood to other students who needed help and despaired that she had not gone with them Kelly Weaver thought of her own children and how at the end of the day she could still go home and hug them What troubled Westerfield most was that none of them had seen it coming After two decades of teaching he considered himself a skilled reader of teenagers He liked to think he could tell when something was bothering one of them just by how they walked into his classroom But with this boy this shooter he had detected nothing Parker sat in Westerfields German class for two school years in a row He could hold an adult conversation He had friends He was making decent grades And as far as anyone could tell he was not being bullied Parkers trial date is pending and in the absence of a plea from his lawyer the judge in the case has entered an automatic plea of not guilty If a boy like that could suddenly turn murderous then in theory any one of their students could do anything Whom could they trust how could they trust after something like this And if the answer was that they couldnt what then Jenny Darnall decided to reevaluate her understanding of what it meant to be a teacher in the first place She had never been particularly compassionate with the students The way she saw it her job was to educate them not give them advice they should be getting from their parents But now she felt as if God were telling her to step up and do more Call parents more and tell them the hard truths she might normally expect them to discover on their own Talk to the kids more too Tell them that they are loved even when theyre being terrible Those things did not feel like part of her job But maybe now they would have to be The schools culinary instructor Amy Cathey was uncertain about these shifting boundaries A few students had called her seeking practical advice about how to navigate their trauma outside school for instance how to tell their own parents that the prospect of lighting fireworks terrified them Cathey didnt mind the calls or the questions But she wondered what would happen when she wasnt there She worried about the graduating seniors And she dreaded returning to anything resembling those eight or so weeks after the shooting when it felt as if she took care of everyone except herself She loved her kids But she also knew herself and she knew she couldnt sustain that anymore In May Marshall Strong signs were still everywhere they wobbled in peoples front yards hung from doors in floral wreaths peeked out the back windows of cars There were even some billboards still up along the highway Some of the teachers had grown weary of these signs They werent over what had happened of course But they were ready to will themselves into the next phase of recovery whatever that might be This was a tricky place to be in part because not everyone reached it at the same time Westerfield waited until the school year officially ended and not a second longer to take the Marshall Strong sign out of his own yard But Mathis couldnt bring herself to take the Marshall Strong bracelet off and her husband was worried They lost a pregnancy early in their marriage and he remembered how afterward she refused to remove the hospital bracelet doing so he suspected would somehow make the miscarriage real to her He worried that the Marshall bracelet was having the same effect facilitating a denial that would ultimately keep her from moving on She managed to tuck the bracelet away in a drawer by summer but even then a part of her wanted to put it back on as if by doing so she could unmake the entire nightmare Amy Cathey Marshall County High Schools culinary instructor Graeme Mitchell for The New York Times One weekend in July Cathey drove from Kentucky to Colorado to meet Paula Reed in person The women had connected on Facebook and had been texting and emailing for weeks If the trip sounded crazy to outside observers it made perfect sense to Reed Driving crosscountry with a small child in tow was a great way to distract a traumatized brain Over breakfast at a diner the two women reviewed the map of their shared reality The terrain was deeply familiar to Reed but still painfully new to Cathey They took turns pointing out various landmarks and junctures the last funeral the first school shooting after yours and nodding in emphatic relief Yes that happened to us too Yes we had the same problem exactly From the inside a mass shooting can feel distinctly unchartable But Reed and Pynoos and Melissa Brymer his colleague at the National Center for Child Traumatic Stress say that while each school shooting is different in its particulars several features are common to all For example Brymer says it can be the secondary trauma that undoes a schools recovery After a shooting everyone wants to talk about how to find the next shooter so that this doesnt happen again Brymer says But thats not what the school itself needs to focus on Weve had suicides car accidents overdoses For a school thats already traumatized she says these followup events can be incredibly devastating Brymer advises schools to conduct mentalhealth screenings before anniversaries to find the people who are struggling most and help them The hierarchy of hurt can split in surprising ways For the most part people closest to the carnage are the most traumatized and people farther away are less so But any teacher might be plagued by any number of things including what they saw and how they responded in the moment One educator might flee the building in a panic leaving his students behind only to be devastated by guilt afterward Another might behave heroically then seethe with resentment over not getting enough recognition Each will need counseling and support to fully recover A common lament among educatorsurvivors is the way that personal boundaries shift within the school community Abbey Clements who taught second grade at Sandy Hook says that after the shooting she would take her entire class to the bathroom at the same time so that no one would have to leave her sight But as they drew their students close she says she and her colleagues distanced themselves from one another Youre afraid that if you start talking about your own trauma you might trigger someone elses she says Youre also afraid of looking weak or unstable afraid youll be asked to leave or take leave if you admit how much youre struggling As a result many teachers bury their fear and anger and guilt until it changes into something else entirely The question of where to erect a memorial or when to take one down can create fierce divisions So might similar questions about how long to allow comfort dogs on campus or what to do with the mountain of gifts and condolences that pile up Students may come close to blows over whether to discuss the shooting during class time Teachers may feel close to doing the same Its not all Kumbaya Clements says When the system is cracked by a trauma of this magnitude a lot of stuff leaks out It gets messy And it can change relationships The job itself also changes Reed spent the rest of her career vaguely wary of all her students You still love them she says and you still bond with them But you never again feel certain that none of them would ever kill you Even teachers who love what they do may think about doing something else If your bank got robbed while you were in it you would never go to that bank again Clements says But with this you have to go back every single day And leaving is not as easy as it sounds Relocating can cost hardwon seniority and the salary that goes with it And separating yourself from the people you just survived a shooting with can be excruciating Theyre the people that trigger you most Clements says But theyre also the only ones who understand what youre going through Because how can anyone understand this that hasnt been through it A Marshall Strong sign near the high school Graeme Mitchell for The New York Times Since the Parkland shooting at least states have introduced measures that would enable educators to carry firearms on the job The idea itself is not new weve been debating it since at least when a gunman killed five children in a oneroom schoolhouse in western Pennsylvania But as the proposed measures indicate lawmakers seem to be considering it with renewed urgency Teachers have largely resisted this call to arms pointing out that it would alter the studentteacher dynamic in irrevocable ways My job is to educate and nurture students Mathis says How am I supposed to then also be prepared to shoot one of them Matthew Mayer a professor of educational psychology at Rutgers Graduate School of Education says that among experts the best solutions to school shootings are not really in dispute basic gun control more and better mentalhealth services and a robust national threatassessment program We also need to help educators create an atmosphere where students who hear about a potential threat feel comfortable sharing that information with adults Many student shooters including Gabe Parker at Marshall County hint about their plans to at least one other person or tell them outright Getting those others to inform teachers is one of our best options for preventing shootings from happening in the first place In February Mayer and his colleagues circulated an eightpoint document titled A Call for Action to Prevent Gun Violence in the United States of America which summarized these and other key actions needed to reduce the risk of school shootings So far educators and publichealth experts have signed it But political will is still missing We keep revisiting the same conversations every five or six years without learning or changing much of anything Mayer says Armed guards and metal detectors make it look like youre doing something You get far fewer points for talking about school climate and mental health The Marshall County school district banned book bags installed metal detectors at the high school and hired four additional resource officers armed deputy sheriffs But Superintendent Lovett agrees that much more is needed Weve made ourselves a fairly hard target he says But truthfully can I sit here and guarantee you that its never going to happen again No I cant As summer waned and the new academic year approached some Marshall teachers were feeling torn Mathis found that while she was not afraid to return to work herself she dreaded sending her own children ages and back to their school She knew that it was safe and that they would be just fine I know nothing is going to happen there she told her colleagues But she could not stop the next thought from coming I thought nothing would happen here Before the shooting Westerfield always said he would quit or retire early if something like this happened Im not dying on the job he would quip But returning felt like a sacred duty How could any teacher who might replace him possibly understand what his students had been through For that matter how would any other school district understand what he had been through At the same time though he was weary with grief Theres this thing inside each of us now he said Weve lost something that we can never get back For Superintendent Lovett who graduated from Marshall some years ago it came down to the simple fact that times had changed Back then as many kids as not had hunting rifles in their trucks and no one ever brought a gun into the building But he thought it was the lot of educators to serve as a constant for both their students and the wider community In four short years every kid who survived the shooting would be gone from the school For the most part faculty and staff members would remain They helped their students through the shooting and its excruciating aftermath And they would be there this fall to see them through the year that followed Students eventually move on he said Educators really dont,teaching in the age of school shootings Theres so much misinformation out there about this Shearer said Theres so much misinformation out there about this one shooting There isnt a blanket one that says this is a school shooting its a shooting in the school You could hear it when you saw it But for the most part you just dont What everybody does is say This is the school

CHEVERLY Md When Che Bullock awoke in a hospital in August the first thing he felt was grateful to be alive Hed been stabbed times outside a nightclub in the Washington DC area and taken by helicopter to a medical center where doctors performed lifesaving surgery Bullocks sense of relief quickly faded first into physical pain and anxiety then into fear and finally into a rage toward his attackers It was kind of like they put a hit out on me said Bullock now He recalled friends coming to his hospital room to stand guard Just days after the stabbing Bullock had recovered enough to return home to the Washington neighborhood where he said hed had a beef with the individuals whod tried to kill him Bullock was prepared to defend himself but also ready to hit back But before he could act Bullock got a call from Joseph Richardson Jr a University of Maryland associate professor offering him an alternative Richardson now invited him to participate in a study on young black men who had been shot or stabbed more than once repeat victims of violence sometimes referred to as frequent flyers Bullock was hesitant thinking Richardson might be working with police but in the end he decided to sign up That study ultimately saved his life Gun violence is an American crisis that leads to more than deaths each year about a third of which are homicides and tens of thousands more nonfatal shootings according to federal data Preventing that violence has been a topic of debate for decades with politicians making glacial progress But Richardson and others have decided to pursue another route offering patients a glimpse into a less violent future that isnt hampered by the political stalemate In September Richardson launched the Capital Region Violence Intervention Program out of the Prince Georges Hospital Center in Cheverly where Bullock was treated The program which arose from Richardsons initial study takes a public health approach treating violence like a disease that can both be spread and inoculated against said Richardson who now serves as codirector Che Bullock left and Joseph Richardson Jr are helping patients find a path away from violence through their work at the Capital Region Violence Intervention Program in Maryland Photo Thomas BachoUniversity of Maryland The model is the areas first hospitalbased violence intervention program or HVIP and is one of about accredited programs in the US with a few more in development and a handful operating internationally HVIPs target the structural causes of violence many of which spring from broader racial and socioeconomic inequalities giving survivors tools to make lifestyle changes that can prevent them from being revictimized or from perpetrating further violence Research shows HVIPs have been effective at reducing violent injury and death which can lead to substantial savings on health care and criminal justice costs Richardsons program which also serves victims of stabbings and other traumas has seen promising results in its first year but it doesnt yet have enough data for a full analysis on results Of the more than patients so far enrolled none has been rehospitalized for violent injury he said Before the programs launch onethird of all violently injured patients they saw had been hospitalized two or more times before Story continues Bullocks road to rehabilitation began in with a simple question One of the first things Dr Richardson asked me is What do you want to do with your life Bullock recalled of their first meeting Richardson at the time was working oneonone with some survivors helping them find social and mental health services Bullock didnt know how to answer the question but Richardson who has a doctorate in criminal justice had an idea He invited Bullock to speak about his personal experience to an African American studies class he was teaching on the modern Jim Crow at the University of Maryland Richardson believed Bullocks life story was important now he just needed to persuade Bullock to share it The following week Bullock headed to campus to tell his story ending with his attack in front of more than students packed in a room You could drop a pin in the auditorium I guess thats how engaged they was Bullock said On the drive home Bullocks mind raced His presentation was a success and the positive response from students left him considering other possibilities for his future Perhaps he could become a motivational speaker But just before he got on the freeway someone shot at his car The bullet missed him but shattered a window leaving him with a gash on his forearm It had only been a few weeks since his stabbing and Bullock once again found himself traumatized and thinking about retaliation I even remember finding out who did it he said Bullock called Richardson to tell him what had happened Richardson urged Bullock to meet with him before doing anything reckless They met again and began to discuss the factors that had led Bullock to be targeted in the first place I started to think about how I was getting my money what were the forces of my financial capital he said Of course it was drugs Richardson suggested he try something different and cut him a check for to speak to his class again I made in an hour and the hustler in me is like how can I turn this into Bullock said When I started getting more and more speaking engagements I really didnt think about retaliating too much because I was focused View photos Bullock and Richardson have helped more than patients in the Capital Region Violence Intervention Programs first year of operation None has been rehospitalized for violent injury Photo Che Bullock More For the first time Bullock saw a different path for his future He continued to work with Richardson over the next four years helping Richardson develop the Capital Region Violence Intervention Program When the program launched last year Richardson hired Bullock to recruit survivors and serve as their case manager When I walk into the rooms now the first thing I ask is whats the plan What do you want to do with your life Bullock said Most guys dont know Bullock meets with patients daily while theyre in the hospital When theyre released he follows up helping to set up goals and identify needs Bullock also works with patients to develop coping mechanisms to manage the stress that can stem from trauma and he urges them to get mental health treatment which he said can be challenging because of a broader stigma in the African American community against seeking help After a neardeath experience experts say theres a golden moment in which survivors are especially receptive to guidance Bullock builds trust and rapport with the patients and then asks them to join the program Some turn him down but so far the program has an enrollment rate of over percent he said Bullock also works to reach out to the friends and loved ones of survivors which is integral to the models success Richardson said If violence is a disease and this person who was injured was infected youre trying to inoculate this person by giving them mental health services and getting them a job but if youre sending that person back to a network of people who are still infected what have we really solved he said Investing In Prevention It costs about a year to run an HVIP serving about patients said Kyle Fischer policy director for both the Maryland program and the National Network of Hospitalbased Violence Intervention Programs The Capital Region program has so far not had trouble securing funding for the immediate future said program director Dawn Moreland But with around survivors of violent injury coming through the hospital each year on average she said additional funding could help them expand to meet the needs of the community The volume will always be there unfortunately said Moreland Well always have more clients to serve Theres reason to believe HVIPs are a worthy investment Gun violence deaths and injuries cost a total of billion each year according to a study that measured direct spending on law enforcement criminal justice and health care related to shootings as well as indirect costs like lost wages and the effects on victims quality of life In other words the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly according to the study Black men account for nearly half of gun homicide victims each year but make up only percent of the population according to a report by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence This phenomenon is often referred to as murder inequality But the racial disparities of gun violence are also evident in the nearly unending stream of nonfatal shootings at the hospital said Dr Sean Benoit a Prince Georges Hospital Center trauma surgeon and codirector of Richardsons program These guys come in after getting shot we send them back out they get shot and they come back in So were just patching them back up Benoit said We have many patients who leave here not even knowing what surgery we did Many survivors who find themselves at the Maryland hospital have normalized violence seeing prison or death as acceptable or even inevitable said Bullock In recent years Benoit has made a habit of bringing his anatomy book to patients to show them how hes operated He said it helps them understand how close they may have come to death Small gestures like that can make huge differences said Benoit A lot of the guys tell us that this is the first time someone actually cared what happened to them that this is the first time they have spoken to anyone who cares if they finish high school or get a GED or go to community college or get a job he said Do HVIPs Really Work Studies indicate that HVIPs prevent violent injury but the research has been limited in size and scope often due to relatively small sample sizes and narrow sets of measured metrics experts say But even in small studies researchers are seeing success By providing wraparound care to survivors participants receive more opportunity for job placement educational advancement housing and even legal aid said Rachel Myers research coordinator of the violence intervention program at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia Its a matter of identifying people who have gone through this recent traumatic injury and really connecting with them in a human way Myers said For survivors just having someone believe in them can help them become productive members of society she said Love HuffPost Become a founding member of HuffPost Plus today Myers who contributed to a study on HVIP outcomes said shed like to see future analysis that pulls from broader pools of clients and attempts to gauge how the programs are tied to socioeconomic and psychosocial factors Richardson is also hoping to help expand the body of evidence on the effect of HVIPs In the coming months he said he plans to begin the largest randomized study ever conducted on the effectiveness of HVIPs which will include a sample of as many as patients at participating programs in the Washington metro area A New Lease On Life TJ King grew up just a few blocks away from Bullock He was hanging out in the neighborhood with friends in June when two men pulled up in a car and fired times striking five people including King All of them survived but Kings injuries were the worst A round entered his back and came out through his chest breaking two ribs and nearly hitting his lung and heart After returning home from Prince Georges Hospital Center King got a call from Bullock asking him to join an earlier iteration of the Capital Region program I actually talked in that group about what happened to me and how I felt and what I was going through King said explaining that he had never expressed himself like that before I probably didnt tell Bullock this but I went home after and cried for like two hours Just months after Kings shooting his mother succumbed to Stage cancer King said he felt the best way to honor her was to continue improving his life He stuck with the program and eventually got a job at Prince Georges Hospital Center transporting patients He also informally meets with survivors when Bullock is off duty King said he hopes to join the program as a fulltime employee soon View photos TJ King left and Che Bullock at the Prince Georges Hospital Center Bullock helped recruit King into the Capital Region Violence Intervention Program after King was shot in Photo Che Bullock More None of it has been easy said King It took a while to come to the realization that it wasnt worth seeking revenge against the people who shot him King has also had to leave behind friends who werent ready to give up the streets he said But along with those changes have come a newfound positivity and passion for life King woke up one morning a few months ago and decided he wanted to go fishing he said Hed never fished before but hed always been interested in it He watched a few videos on casting and baiting bought two fishing rods and headed to the Potomac River the next day He caught his first fish Over the past few months Kings love of fishing has grown Hes taught his friends how to fish including the ones who were shot alongside him last year Sometimes hell take kids from the neighborhood to his favorite spots Before he got shot King never thought hed be the kind of person who gets up at the crack of dawn just to sit by the water for hours hoping for a fish to bite Now there are fishing rods in his trunk at all times he said a reminder that anyone can transform their life even if they need a little help doing it The same way we got turned around its possible the next person can turn around King

CNN For school designers and architects the current debate about how to make schools safer focuses too much on addon measures Metal detectors More resource officers Armed teachers Bulletproof backpacks These security steps whether effective or not dont address the fundamental way that a school works or how people move through it They also must be balanced with the need to create an environment where kids feel inspired and energized to learn As students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and across the country return to classes this week CNN spoke to designers architects and security experts to answer a sobering question How do you design a school in the age of the mass shooting Their answers which follow a theory known as Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design illuminate the delicate balance between security and education It should be inspiring space It should be lit with daylight It should be a place where everyone feels welcome said Sue Pruchnicki principal at Bond Architects a St Louis firm that has designed many new schools Our task is to make it safer without making it look like a fortress Perimeter landscaping that makes visitors visible The entrance to this middle school designed by PBKIN Architecture includes large glass windows protective poles and an entrance clearly outlined in red One main idea of designing safety is to create several layers of security or concentric rings of access starting with the perimeter and then working inward into the school If there is an intruder each layer of security is designed to delay him or her until first responders can arrive The outermost layer of security is the landscape leading up to the entrance Designers said they try to create a perimeter where everyone has to walk up on foot so that people inside the school can easily see who is coming Folks have to come up on a pedestrian level said Art Bond principal of Bond Architects In practice that means the area around the entrance might have a pathway through a low shrubbery or a garden so that there are no places to hide Some schools might have a pedestrian bridge out front to funnel visitors to that main entrance In addition visitor parking lots and bus dropoffs are located in separate areas further from the school entrance so visitors have to walk to the entrance Bollards or strategically placed planters near the entrance can also be used to prevent someone driving into the building We want to make sure that we have lots of windows so that administrators people that are in charge can see folks approaching the building said Bill Payne CEO of architecture and design firm Fanning Howey A single entrance point At an elementary school in Zanesville Ohio visitors enter an enclosed vestibule connected to the front office when they walk into the school After the shooting at Santa Fe High School in May Texas Lt Gov Dan Patrick blamed the shooting on too many entrances and too many exits at the school The comment was mocked by some as door control but he was making a real point Many new schools are now built with a single primary entrance that all students teachers and visitors must come through In design what we want to make sure is that we can visually observe anybody that approaches the building and then pass them through a filtering process Payne explained The idea is to have a better way to control who visits the schools and in the case of an emergency to create an additional barrier to anyone seeking to do harm Architects are designing schools where visitors encounter a single entrance point in a vestibule or antechamber The visitors then must talk to an administrator or secretary to present their ID and reason for being there and only then are they allowed to pass through another set of doors to get into the school For example the firm Fanning Howey built the West Muskingum Learning Center in Zanesville Ohio with a vestibule that leads visitors to a front office Ken Trump the president of National School Safety and Security Services said the vestibules help with whats called visitor management You reconfigure the front entrance way of the school so instead of being able to just walk right in to the school you get funneled to the office to get checked in he said These vestibule doors are generally left open during the morning and afternoon rush and then closed once classes begin There are also many oneway exits around the school that can be opened in case of a fire or other emergency One way in multiple ways out Payne said Reinforced doors Visitors to an elementary school in St Louis County must first enter a secure vestibule with a banktellerlike glass window This vestibule renovated in has glass that is protected by security glazing During the Sandy Hook shooting the gunman used an assault weapon to shoot through the vestibule glass and enter the building With that in mind some schools are strengthening the glass and reinforcing the doors of their entrances to make the school a harder target for any intruder That has become a robust market for some businesses Total Security Solutions is a company that designs plans and produces bullet resistant barriers for schools but in a way that keeps the doors from looking too intimidating We try to do that in a way that blends into the architecture something thats visually pleasing that doesnt look like Fort Knox or prison said Rick Reid market segment leader with Total Security Solutions Reinforcing every single door in the school isnt tenable or cost effective he said Total Security Solutions mainly works to reinforce the vestibule at the single entrance point of the school Other designers add a security film to the glass in the vestibule entrance with the idea of slowing down an intruder The security film although not bulletproof keeps the glass in its frame like a car windshield so intruders cant simply shatter the glass and walk right into the school Its gonna take them longer to enter and by then hopefully someone notices and somebody puts the building in lockdown so that police can be on their way said Irene Nigaglioni president of IN Architecture The vestibules and hardened doors can also host metal detectors However their use remains a fraught issue among designers and security experts who say metal detectors may not be helpful in stopping an intruder and create unintended consequences such as logjams More importantly they say metal detectors send the wrong message to students To me theres a very negative message that is sent when you walk into your school building through metal detectors Nigaglioni said It just doesnt send that message of This is a safe and welcoming place that you need to learn Wider open hallways Hallways at new schools are designed to be open collaborative spaces with clear lines of sight so that teachers and school administrators can observe New schools also are being designed with wide open hallways that provide clear lines of sight This gives teachers administrators and school resource officers the ability to stand at one spot and see whats going on all around Having open hallways without nooks and crannies also gives surveillance cameras a fuller view of the school In modern schools these hallways function as throughways as well as collaborative working spaces similar to a Starbucks Nigaglioni said These open hallways also can be sealed off electronically in the case of an emergency adding one more layer of security In a lockdown students would go to their classrooms and lock that door too creating yet another barrier The overall idea is to create a collaborative learning environment that can function as another zone of security to allow time for police to arrive The doors that separate this wing of the school from the main building can be electronically closed in a lockdown situation That hardened approach where everybodys in enclosed little silos is not what were attempting to do Payne said Were more interested in keeping the perpetrator or attacker at bay so the first responders can arrive in time Pruchnicki of Bond Architects said that classrooms are now labeled with large numbers that jut out from the wall That makes it easier for first responders not to mention new students or substitute teachers to quickly locate a specific room on the schools campus Of course school security is much more than just the threat of active shootings Schools also have to deal with bullying sexual assaults weather emergencies and estranged parents say in a custody battle who may want to pull their kids out of school The newest school designs have multiple focuses to address all of these issues On a daytoday basis you want to design schools and focus on things that will help with monitoring with supervision and communication dealing with bullying prevention and those types of issues Trump said They go beyond just the tunnel vision focus on a shooter,how to design a school in

This story is being copublished with the Appeal a nonprofit criminal justice news outlet On the evening of Nov Adarius Montrells Sims of Birmingham Alabama was driving his gold Grand Am home Tired after hanging out all night he fell asleep at the wheel The car crashed and medics found Sims unconscious After the crash a police officer peering into the wreck spotted a caliber pistol on the passengerside floorboard Police ran Sims name and saw he had two prior marijuana possession convictions a record that made that gun illegal in Alabama But Sims hadnt hurt anyone and his record was nonviolent So he was sent to a gun court rehabilitation program paying fines and taking classes on anger management While taking part in the program he met with a federal agent from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives who told him that he could still face federal charges despite the local gun program he was agreeing to I had told him I was doing gun court but he was saying they overrule all of that and if they wanted me they could get me Sims recalled But he said they werent going to I dont got a violent history Over the next two years this apparent promise of discretion seemed to hold No other charges from the incident were brought and Sims began to move on The father of two got a new construction job and his girlfriend became pregnant Sims had no idea however that hundreds of miles away in Washington the new Attorney General Jeff Sessions was reversing the previous administrations course on federal gun charges which had dropped steadily throughout the Obama era Focused on what he called the nations rising tide of violent crime Sessions wanted to prosecute more gun cases to deter those he deemed most likely to commit violent crime people with guns and felony records In March only a month after assuming his post Sessions announced his game plan He ordered all federal prosecutors nationwide to prioritize firearm prosecutions especially for illegal possession Federal prosecutors would be evaluated by their commitment to such tactics Sessions announced later that year as part of a reinvigorated Department of Justice program known as Project Safe Neighborhoods A few months after his initial call to action federal gun prosecutions ramped up by percent In the first half of attorneys who worked under Sessions took on more firearms cases than any previous administration in the same time period This widened net eventually caught Sims Sometime around May of this year while working on a construction site Sims got an angry call from his father Federal agents had come to his fathers apartment looking for him He didnt know why He cooperated and had them pick him up at work Only then did he realize he was again facing charges this time from federal prosecutors for the same gun found in his crashed car more than two years ago The next month Sims pleaded guilty to felon gun possession He will be sentenced in January on a charge that carries about five years in federal prison on average A local conviction for felon gun possession may only result in probation time especially in states with permissive gun laws The punishment banishes leading violent offenders from their support networks and isolates them in longterm imprisonment At President Donald Trumps request Sessions resigned from his post this month But hes left in place a formidable assembly line that transfers lowlevel gun cases from counties nationwide to federal prosecutors That assembly line which Sessions called his centerpiece crime reduction initiative is still processing thousands of people across the country with no sign of slowing In his resignation letter Sessions alluded to the program as one of his major achievements boasting that under his watch US attorneys prosecuted the largest number of violent offenders and firearms defendants in our countrys history And most observers expect that this toughoncrime model which Trump praised during his presidential campaign is likely to remain a DOJ priority The initiative has federal prosecutors adopt ongoing gun cases from local police and prosecutors or mine local court dockets for already adjudicated cases involving guns The resulting federal sentences are generally longer and can send people to federal facilities far from home The punishment banishes leading violent offenders from their support networks and isolates them in longterm imprisonment The combined damage is supposed to serve as a powerful deterrent Sessions explained the underlying logic during his Senate confirmation hearing Criminals are most likely the kind of person that will shoot somebody when they go about their business he said And if those people are not carrying guns because they believe they might go to federal court be sent to a federal jail for five years perhaps theyll stop carrying those guns during that drug dealing and their other activities that are criminal Fewer people get killed Despite Sessions departure the data suggest that local law enforcement in certain parts of the country have responded enthusiastically to these calls Since the Trump administration took office federal prosecutors gun caseloads adopted from cops and county prosecutors below have risen to a rate never before seen And as with previous administrations a majority of these gun charges are hitting black defendants In fiscal year for example percent of defendants convicted of felon in possession of a firearm were black Such disparities have held constant throughout the years On the morning of Sept the ballroom of the Wynfrey Hotel in Hoover Alabama was packed with prosecutors They had flown in from across the country to hear Sessions discuss his vision for combating violent crime Sessions who aggressively prosecuted gun cases during his stint as a US attorney in Alabama rallied the troops insisting that their work was helping to combat the slight uptick in violent crime seen in and The indictments from the gun roundup however suggest that many of the defendants were stopped randomly for lowlevel infractions Weve charged the most federal firearms prosecutions in a decade and were not just putting people in jail our efforts are bearing fruit Sessions declared crediting the program for preliminary data showing a drop in violent crime Seated next to Sessions that day was Jay Town northern Alabamas yearold US attorney Like Sessions decades ago Town has made a name for himself by zealously carrying out Washingtons gun prosecution agenda an approach that regularly earned him the former attorney generals praise Of all US attorney districts nationwide Towns northern Alabama office is among the top raw and per capita for the violent crime prosecutions Sessions prioritized in March percent of which are gun cases Most of the districts topping the list are also in the South To achieve these numbers Town has built a prosecution pipeline routing cases from local law enforcement all across northern Alabama to his office Last year Town met with all countylevel prosecutors in his district and instituted a program streamlining the process by which county prosecutors can refer gun cases to his office At the same time Town has been working closely with the ATF which has been taking over cases after local police encounter residents with guns and felony records In May for example under the mantle of Project Safe Neighborhoods Town announced the arrests and indictments of people on gun charges saying that local prosecutors had brought him their most serious gun cases We asked them to bring us their worst cases bring us your trigger pullers Town told local media which proceeded to publish the mug shots of numerous defendants almost all black The indictments from the gun roundup however suggest that many of the defendants were stopped randomly for lowlevel infractions Towns office published the names of of the people But only a handful were charged federally because of gun offenses that indicated serious violent intentions such as the production of a firearm silencer Most cases stemmed from runofthemill police operations such as controlled buys traffic infractions or responses to residents calls about suspicious activity Although many of these cases are lowlevel and sometimes based on random police encounters Town has said that authorities are going after top targets based on prior intelligence The defendants that were prosecuting were not always going to get them for their worst offenses he said to local media in October But they are our worst offenders But several Alabama police officers and prosecutors working on the program with Towns office told the Appeal that federal prosecutors seem to be accepting a wide range of everyday gun offender cases rather than targeting select people Christina Kilgore chief deputy district attorney of Talladega County said her office sends gun cases federal whenever an opportunity presents itself If a defendant has a felony history and is caught for possession she said in a phone interview either local police will send it to the ATF or her office will refer it to federal prosecutors I dont know what other factors anyones considering she said We dont have an agenda as to which were picking and which ones were not picking Similarly a police officer who requested anonymity citing fears of professional reprisal said that he sees his department referring all gun cases that they can to federal law enforcement authorities like the ATF There are people who should never see the light of day again but there are also people who made a mistake years ago but are law abiding and now need a gun for protection the officer said Theres no distinction between those two types It bothers a lot of people in law enforcement This wide net is being cast they say because federal prosecutors have not given locals targeted guidance for when to send cases federal According to one prosecutor who requested anonymity because of being unauthorized to speak on the subject federal prosecutors are just taking cases whenever it means more time Nobody has asked whats the criteria for the worst of the worst The program is just chasing numbers said another prosecutor who requested anonymity citing fears of professional reprisal The message is target but what they do is net The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment about these criticisms of Project Safe Neighborhoods Sessions model for combating gun violence is premised on the idea that the fear of incarceration and exile will compel people to put down their guns But the programs design does not address the social conditions that cause people to carry argues Andrew Papachristos a sociology professor at Northwestern University whose work focuses on gun violence The irony of the programs target selection is that the group most likely to be victimized is most likely to carry guns Papachristos noted You have to make people feel safer thats the reason these guys are carrying guns Living in public housing Sims said he saw people getting robbed at night or caught in crossfire and felt he needed protection Until I was grown I didnt need to have a gun he said I was a sports guy but as I grown up and got kids I needed to protect them Gun violence is concentrated in west Birmingham the poorer side of the city that has an overwhelmingly black population Several men with felony records in Ensley one of the west sides neighborhoods told the Appeal that they understood the risks of carrying guns but choose to carry anyway because of the daytoday dangers they face Of all major American cities Birmingham had the fourthhighest murder rate per capita from August to July Its murder rate during that period murders per residents is higher than New York Citys was at the height of the crack epidemic And as of according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Alabama ranked second highest in the country for gun deaths per capita Given this high exposure to violence the threat of law enforcement punishment for gun possession did not register very highly to respondents Less than percent of gun holders surveyed felt that police were likely to catch someone for holding guns or even shooting at someone And even if they knew they were going to be arrested only percent said this guarantee of punishment would make them less likely to carry The omission of this reality may help explain why the models effects on violent crime historically have been fairly minimal argues Alex Vitale a sociology professor at Brooklyn College whose research focuses on policing Throughout the s and s concentrated federal gun prosecution programs were tried across the country with mixed results One study on Richmond Virginia found that it possibly sped up a decline in gun murders in the early s while another concluded it had zero impact A study of the first iteration of Project Safe Neighborhoods which Sessions frequently cited in public speeches found the program only produced a percent drop in violent crime during its existence in the early s Despite these small magnitude results Vitale argues Sessions clung to the strategy because of a puritanical political vision which demanded retribution against the criminal forces of lawlessness I dont think they really understand the reality of why people carry said Vitale referring to supporters of Sessions toughoncrime approach Theyre so committed to the Manichean worldview and deterrencebased understanding of human nature that the only way they can respond to the failure of their programs is to double down on them This bipartisan consensus on guns however has hurt people like Adarius Sims Sessions got his first taste for harsh federal sentences against gun holders in the early s as a federal prosecutor under President George HW Bush Bush had won his election in part by tarring his opponent Michael Dukakis with the racist Willie Horton ad campaign suggesting to voters that Dukakis was too lenient on black criminals With violent crime rates at an alltime high his administrations federal prosecutors began prioritizing daytoday drug and gun cases shifting away from former focuses like civil rights and whitecollar crime Following Bushs call to take back the streets from vicious thugs Sessions ramped up gun cases as the Trace documented often hitting people simply caught for illegal guns or drug activity Since the s federal administrations have consistently flaunted toughoncrime initiatives to appeal to the fears and desires of white voters notes Vitale Sessions encouraged his allies to exploit the political value of such gestures for decades In a memo to President Ronald Reagans attorney general for example Sessions pushed the White House to take on draconian anticrime bills as a trap for its liberal opponents After they have come forth and identified themselves as sympathizers for drug smugglers and other assorted criminals congregating about the bait they should then be flattened by the President in a fullscale campaign on behalf of the legislation he wrote We support stability and order they wander about wringing their hands crying for the criminals while violence everywhere escalates As attorney general Sessions used similarly charged language when discussing violent crime and gun violence frequently pitting the law abiding people of this country against the violent thugs and poison peddlers Since the programs launch US attorneys offices across the country have held press conferences announcing largescale arrests and getting photos of guns and mug shots of black defendants published in local news outlets The political dangers on the other hand seem to be minimal Both gun rights and gun control advocates have publicly praised Sessions federal gun prosecutions The National Rifle Association says its the best way to deter gun crime The nonprofit Brady Campaign argues that prosecutors should hit illegal gun purchasers in addition to other targets like gun suppliers This bipartisan consensus on guns however has hurt people like Adarius Sims Sims says he tries not to think about the charges and keeps up his normal routine without telling many people about whats happening Ive been working doing what I have to do he said I really dont think about it I pray every day Leave it up to God Though the average punishment for his charge is about five years Sims and his girlfriend who doesnt have a job are hoping the judge will be lenient Hopefully they see my background and they keep me on probation Im hoping Though he faces sentencing in just a few months he hasnt talked to his kids about it They really wont understand theyre so young he said Sims insists he should not be considered one of the leading violent offenders that federal prosecutors claim to be targeting Asked why he is now facing perhaps several years in prison Sims said I dont know I really dont know Im not a trigger puller or violent I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,jeff sessions gun prosecution machine goes after many black nonviolent offenders is a bad system This is all good in the grand scheme of things The president seems to support and support the law enforcement of his states the public believes it is constitutional to arrest and jail people who engage in illegal behavior a situation we do not think matters much to the American people On the most basic level why is it that the president of this country has,jeff sessions in That was the peak although in the grand scheme of things it wasnt so much a peak as a precipitous fall into a hellish state Most of us were in our s at

Not even two weeks ago President Donald Trump appeared to buck the National Rifle Association publicly endorsing Democraticfriendly guncontrol ideas while mocking other Republicans as petrified of the powerful firearms lobby They have great power over you people Trump said on Feb referring to the NRA while addressing a group of lawmakers at the White House They have less power over me But now Trump has retreated putting forward a modest package of gunsafety measures this week that has none of the provisions opposed by the NRA that he seemed to back days earlier The shift provides another example of the strong influence wielded by the NRA both at the White House and on Capitol Hill where most lawmakers remain opposed to significant policy changes in the wake of the shooting massacre that killed at a Parkland Florida high school last month I think we could all see it coming I wish the president had televised the meeting with the NRA like he televised the meeting with us Sen Chris Murphy DConn said Monday referring to a March huddle between Trump and top officials at the gun rights group Clearly the NRA was more persuasive than I was In the face of such criticism Trump defended his plan in a series of tweets Monday morning Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House Legislation moving forward Bump Stocks will soon be out Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry subject to State Law Armed guards OK deterrent Trump wrote in one Twitter message White House officials said Trumps official gun plan was drafted within the confines of what Congress will allow a notable contrast to Trumps I alone can fix it image as someone who could singlehandedly cut through Washington gridlock Administration officials also disputed that Trumps plan amounts to a reversal of his positions since that February meeting when the president surprised lawmakers of both parties by appearing to back proposals to raise the purchase age for ARs and similar types of rifles and to expand background checks He also declared at that meeting that law enforcement officials should take the guns first go through due process second for those suspected of mental illness He hasnt backed away from these things at all White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said during a contentious backandforth with reporters Monday But he cant make them happen with a broad stroke of the pen You have to have some congressional component to do some of these things and without that support its not as possible Publicly Republican senators had dismissed Trumps embrace of Democraticfriendly gun measures as the negotiating tactic of a businessman who wanted to hear from all sides before coming to a decision His defenders on Capitol Hill said much the same Monday arguing that Trumps plan was crafted in political reality considering the composition of Congress Ive called the meeting we had at the White House on TV really more of a brainstorming session It was not a legislative strategy session Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn RTexs said Monday I think as the president and the White House has talked to Congress they found out what is achievable and whats not Yet Vice President Mike Pence spoke with a number of Senate Republicans who privately raised serious concerns about what Trump said at the gun summit according to one White House official who was not authorized to talk on the record and so spoke on the condition of anonymity Montanas Sen Steve Daines was among the GOP lawmakers who reached out to the administration with worries about what was said conveying his concerns to the White Houses legislative staff We really reengaged and reemphasized the points I made to the president in that meeting First thing we need to do to make kids safe is to make our schools safe Daines said Monday Im pleased to see that hes moved away from a focus on gun control and now focused on stopping people who have a homicidal intent At a meeting on March NRA lobbyist Chris Cox told Trump that some of his ideas particularly raising the age limit to buy a semiautomatic rifle from to wouldnt pass and that raising the age wouldnt stop crimes according to people briefed on the meeting Cox also said the background check legislation being supported by the White House would go too far these people said Trump saw the arguments as convincing said two people who later spoke to him The meeting was warm these people said with the president telling Cox that he valued the NRA and wanted to be on the same page Cox and NRA President Wayne LaPierre who met with Trump earlier made clear to the president that the NRA supported him and did not want to be at odds The president was also taken aback by how many GOP lawmakers told him that his proposals were unlikely to pass two senior administration officials said He later told others in the White House that he wanted to support only legislation that could pass One senior administration official said Trump was never determined to pass everything he proposed or seemed to suggest in the bipartisan summit but likes to publicly gauge what others are thinking House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows RNC told Trump that broad gun laws were not going to pass according to a senior administration official A number of senior aides also told the president that there were not enough votes on the Hill to raise the purchase age for some guns the official said At first he really wanted to do it everyone was telling him embrace this moment one Trump adviser said But now he is telling people how supportive the NRA has been to him He knows they are an important ally Another senior administration official said that Trump does things on the fly in sessions like the one on guns and that they arent real promises or formal positions His team was already drafting legislative proposals that mirrored what eventually came out this official said Now the Trump administration is focused on two main pieces of legislation a bill to improve the federal background check database and a measure to shore up safety at schools including grants to fund violenceprevention training for teachers and students Both are broadly popular on Capitol Hill although a handful of Republican senators are objecting to speedy passage of the background check bill The White House also wants states to pass bills for riskprotection orders which allow law enforcement to take guns away from people considered a public threat and it is establishing a Federal Commission on School Safety to be chaired by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that will explore possible solutions Trumps plan does not include an endorsement of a bipartisan measure written by Sens Joe Manchin DWVa and Patrick Toomey RPa to expand background checks to firearms sales at gun shows and online purchases confusing key lawmakers who believed that Trump would get on board with the bill Why did he talk about it so favorably in the public meeting Manchin asked of Trump and his bill I dont think the president seemed to be concerned about that but Im sure some of the more politically astute staff may be Despite the White Houses comments that it was working within the realm of the possible some proposals in Trumps plan arent politically achievable in Congress One of the most controversial would give rigorous firearms training to some teachers to protect students an idea that would struggle mightily to pass I dont think theres a lot of support for that Sen Orrin Hatch RUtah a reliable ally of the White House said Monday I just dont think that theres a move to arm teachers Im not particularly opposed to that but there would have to be tremendous training and tremendous effort to make that work The Washington Posts Philip Rucker contributed to this report,they have less power over me trump retreats from vow to stand up to nra But many Trump opponents have insisted they would have backed the president if he hadnt been so aggressive especially when the women in attendance had asked him about his plans for dealing with the Islamic State We had hoped he would go back to that path said Michael Flynn now the White Houses national security adviser Thats what hes done Donald Trumps national,president trump at the white house on monday

CNN Two signs of the times another mass shooting and more Twitter outrage This time though the barbs over social media came from the medical community in response to a tweet from the National Rifle Association The pilingon began after the NRA tweeted on Wednesday a link to an article from its Institute of Legislative Action The article titled Surprise Physician Group Rehashes Same Tired Gun Control Policies was promoted with these words Someone should tell selfimportant antigun doctors to stay in their lane Half of the articles in Annals of Internal Medicine are pushing for gun control Most upsetting however the medical community seems to have consulted NO ONE but themselves Someone should tell selfimportant antigun doctors to stay in their lane Half of the articles in Annals of

Borderline Bar Grill in Thousand Oaks California and killed at least people before turning his gun on himself The NRAs tweet had more than likes by midThursday But it also riled up people inside and

Nuriel Moghavem MD November ive reviewed the literature wrote and there are basically no studies on the therapeutic benefits of getting shot ive reviewed the literature and there are basically no studies on the therapeutic benefits of getting shot kyalectics November What drove the NRAs criticism a recent article in Annals of Internal Medicine a leading academic medical journal coincidentally published in late October in the aftermath of the Pittsburgh synagogue shootings and the killing of two AfricanAmericans in a Kentucky Kroger store In the article the American College of Physicians shared new recommendations on how doctors can play a role in reducing gun violence across the country The medical association has long maintained that firearmrelated deaths and injuries should be treated as an urgent public health crisis The recommendations include urging doctors to more regularly ask whether patients have guns in their home and to counsel patients on gun safety The argument also comes at a time when organizations like Scrubs Addressing the Firearm Epidemic known as SAFE are coming together to demand an increase in federal funding for gun violence research while calling on lawmakers to implement evidencebased policy on guns A spokeswoman for the NRA dismissed the flood of comments The socalled uproar on twitter or what could be characterized as a normal exchange of emotions and uninformed opinions has nothing to do with the substance of the article being promoted in the tweet Its clear form the comments that they didnt read the article Jennifer Baker wrote in an email Its just another example of gun control advocates with the help of the mainstream media blaming law abiding gun owners for the criminal acts of deranged people and exploiting tragedy to push a gun control agenda that would not prevent these crimes The gun control policies they advocate for are already the law in California and they did not prevent last nights tragedy Baker added that the focus on the NRA is misguided If medical organizations would like to concentrate on a public health crisis she wrote they should focus on the mental health crisis that results in nearly suicides per year the medical communitys complicity in the opioid crisis that takes over lives per year or the deaths due to medical errors Few NRA supporters appeared to get into the Twitter mix with the doctors nurses and others But some stepped onto the field like who said This is a crime issue not a public health issue Doctors arrogantly deem anything they feel strongly about to be a public health issue to

BALTIMORE AP The young man who opened fire at a Florida video game tournament had shown abundant signs he was struggling with a mental disorder He was prescribed an antipsychotic drug as an adolescent and had been hospitalized at least twice for mental illness Yet David Katz landed at the foggy intersection of Americas mental health and legal systems when it came to buying the two handguns that police say he carried during the attack which killed two people and wounded others during the Madden NFL competition in Jacksonville The rampage ended when the yearold Baltimore man fatally shot himself Experts say the gunmans history of mental illness apparently would not have stopped him from buying guns in Maryland where buyers cannot pass a background check if they were either involuntarily committed for any period of time or voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility for at least consecutive days Court papers filed in his parents bitter divorce do not clearly indicate whether Katz was hospitalized voluntarily or involuntarily and the two hospitalizations described in the documents were both shorter than days In addition Katzs hospitalizations may have occurred before the Maryland General Assembly revamped the states firearms laws following the mass shooting at Virginia Tech It appears that these disqualifications did not apply to David Katz said Daniel Webster director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research The Jacksonville shooting is just the latest US case to illustrate the complexities of keeping dangerously unstable people from purchasing guns A Maryland legislator said the attack highlights the need to review laws governing the length of time someone can be voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility and still pass a background check for firearms That clearly is an area in need of reform said Democratic Sen Robert Zirkin who chairs a Senate committee that handles gun laws Maryland lawmakers will gather in January for their annual day legislative session in Annapolis where people are still grieving the loss of five people gunned down at a newspaper office earlier this year The gunmans attorneys are considering an insanity defense Under federal law people are generally prohibited from acquiring guns if they have ever been involuntarily committed to a psychiatric facility Nationally theres no federal requirement for psychiatric hospitals or courts to report involuntary commitments to the FBI for inclusion in a database used for gunpurchase background checks Some states have their own laws In Maryland where Katz purchased a mm handgun and caliber handgun state law requires courts to report to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System whenever people are declared mentally incompetent to stand trial or assigned a guardian because they cannot manage their affairs In addition Maryland law requires psychiatric facilities that admit an individual to submit a report to the State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene As part of the gunpurchase application Maryland state police require applicants written authorization for the state health agency to disclose whether they suffer from a mental disorder have a history of violent behavior or have been confined for more than consecutive days to a mental health facility Maryland state troopers are responsible for investigating gun purchases but for now they are not talking to avoid interfering with the investigation in Jacksonville spokesman Greg Shipley said Katzs parents frequently disagreed on how to care for their troubled son with his father at times claiming his estranged wife was exaggerating symptoms of mental illness The couple divorced in The suspects father Richard Katz of Baltimore and his mother Elizabeth Katz of Columbia Maryland did not respond to phone messages from The Associated Press Efforts to reach them and other relatives at their homes were also unsuccessful A psychologist once warned a family court that David Katz might become violent Katz could lash out and become so angry that he would hit and hurt his mother Dr Paul Berman told the court The divorce papers in Howard County Maryland say Katz started obsessively playing video games as a boy sometimes refusing to go to school or to bathe Elizabeth Katz a toxicologist who worked at the Department of Agriculture said in court papers that she would confiscate some of her sons gaming equipment after finding him playing games in the wee hours At one point she put his gaming controllers in her bedroom behind a locked door and he punched a hole in the door she said When a boy he sometimes curled up into a ball refused to attend school and sobbed she said She asserted that her exhusband a NASA engineer instructed David not to take Risperidal an antipsychotic medication prescribed to him In late Katz was admitted to the Sheppard Pratt mental health system near his Maryland home for about days Court documents say a psychiatrist at that time administered antidepressants He later spent about days at Potomac Ridge a mental health services facility in Rockville Witte reported from Annapolis Maryland Associated Press Writer Michael Biesecker contributed from Washington,shooting suspect was able to buy guns despite mental illness at the time according to a statement from the police Because the shooting was

Liberals and opponents of the Second Amendment argue gun laws in the United States are too soft and allow people who are legally prohibited from owning guns to purchase them However a government experiment conducted last year found that theory to be completely untrue What happened Members of Congress recently asked government investigators to assess how well the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives was enforcing federal gun laws So investigators with the Government Accountability Office set out to test how well laws were being followed and enforced According to a GAO report investigators sought to determine if private online sellers sold firearms to people who are legally barred from purchasing or possessing them The results were undeniable What did the experiment find The report states that investigators posing online as gun buyers who were not legally able to purchase a firearm were completely unsuccessful when attempting to purchase firearms from private sellers In fact the report states that investigators tried times and each time they failed Testsdemonstrated that private sellers GAO contacted on gun forums and other classified ads were unwilling to sell a firearm to an individual who appeared to be prohibited from possessing a firearm the report states The investigators looked for private sellers in online gun ads not federally licensed firearm dealers who are required to run a background check for every purchase In cases the seller ultimately refused to ship the firearm or terminated the transaction because the undercover agent admitted they were unable to legally purchase or possess a firearm In five other cases the agents online accounts were frozen preventing them from even accessing a forum area to browse firearms for sale The remaining attempts turned out to be scams Each attempt was made on the surface web according to the report which is the part of the internet you access when you open your browser Meanwhile the agents also tried purchasing firearms from the dark web an area of the internet where much illegal activity happens and requires a special browser to access The agents attempted seven purchases on the dark web and only came away successful twice They were able to buy an AR with an obliterated serial number and an Uzi that was advertised as fully automatic,investigators test how well gun laws work online and find shocking results that undermine liberals fundamental understanding of human behavior We need a conversation about the role of political influence in American society this is our chance to do so This article was originally published at Mediumcom,a gun shop in florida a government experiment found that private online dealers sold guns to people who are legal barred from selling them iStockPhoto via Getty Images In Congress passed the SAFE Act Safest Neighborhood Gun Safety Act which changed the definition of a weapon The gun law passed in banned possession of handguns and magazines that have been modified to carry more than six rounds But when Florida lawmakers passed a gun trafficking bill the practice,1

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is considering allowing states to use federal grant money to buy guns for schools people familiar with the matter said Two people said the question has been raised inside the Education Department as to whether states are allowed to use money available through Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants to buy firearms Unlike other federal grants this one does not expressly prohibit such purchases Allowing schools to use federal money to buy firearms would fuel anger among those who say the response to school shootings should be fewer guns not more But it could find support among gun rights advocates who say that having firearms in schools would make them less likely to be targeted The department is constantly considering and evaluating policy issues particularly issues related to school safety said Education Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill The secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios Advertisement The policy consideration was first reported by the New York Times The conversation was sparked because the federal law that created the grants includes few constraints people familiar with the matter said Congress wrote a vague law and everyone is trying to figure out what it means one person said adding that Congress should clarify its intentions and bar such purchases if it does not want to allow them The person added that it is possible DeVos would take no action on this matter not expressly permitting it nor advising against it In that case a state could try to force her hand by using its grant money for gun purchases and seeing if the department tries to block it The grant program at issue is meant to be a flexible funding source for states to improve student academic achievement Exact funding levels depend on annual appropriations but can amount to millions of dollars per state each year Advertisement The program was not created with school safety or firearms in mind But while another federal program explicitly prohibits use of grant money for guns these grants do not The idea was swiftly met with criticism from several education groups and parents of school shooting victims JoAnn Bartoletti executive director of the National Assn of Secondary School Principals condemned the use of the grant funds called Title IV in federal education law for firearms Its a perverse distortion of Title IVs goal of enhancing student learning Bartoletti said Under the guide of flexibility the secretary continues to abdicate her responsibility to advance sound researchbased efforts to safeguard students Advertisement Fred Guttenberg whose daughter Jaime was killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland Fla reacted angrily to the suggestion that federal education funds would be used to buy guns Devos after my daughter was murdered you yelled Dont talk about guns talk about mental health Guttenberg posted to Twitter Your brain dead plan will pull money from mental health The conversation about using federal funds for guns appears to be happening independently from deliberations of a school safety commission created by President Trump that is led by DeVos The commission is expected to include a section in its report on best practices for arming school personnel several people familiar with that process aid During its public meetings the commission has heard strong arguments both for and against more guns in schools Advertisement Trump has called for arming teachers as a way to harden schools and suggested paying them extra if they agree to carry weapons You give them a little bit of a bonus so practically for free you have now made the school into a hardened target he said in February DeVos has said that the commission would not consider proposals for gun restrictions One exception is a proposal to raise the minimum age at which people may buy guns,betsy devos considers allowing schools to use federal funds to buy guns That does little to help lowincome students The Senate voted Tuesday to approve HB the states first major gun bills which would also permit businesses and universities to purchase guns through firearms licensees and state security agencies If approved HB would prohibit state agencies from purchasing firearms from stateaffiliated organizations or private dealers It would also require that weapons purchases and sale,betsy devos the education secretary is considering allowing states to use federal grant money to buy guns for schools The Education Department has had billion invested in guns for more than years And last month after taking back the million for gun violence prevention Obama pledged to take a lead role in developing gun safety strategies in schools Weve got to get these schools working Obama said in a speech at the White House We have to,1

Washington CNN The Brett Kavanaugh hearings have been dominated by textbook conversations about the reach of the Second Amendment but on Friday that changed with testimony from a student about her own experience cowering under a fellow students dead body as the Parkland Florida shootings played out last February We heard a round of extremely loud pops Eastmond said according to her prepared testimony Her first thought was that it was a senior prank until she saw red on the floor She began smelling and inhaling smoke and gunpowder and then one of her classmates fell in front of her I then placed myself underneath his lifeless body she will say She expressed concern about Kavanaughs nomination and recalled Parkland father Fred Guttenbergs encounter with Kavanaugh earlier this week Guttenberg accused Kavanaugh of ignoring him as he tried to shake his hand Sources close to Kavanaugh pushed back saying the nominee had no idea who the man Fred Guttenberg was and that security intervened to end the exchange Eastmond talked about phone calls she made to her own parents I immediately called my mom I told her my last goodbye and I told her how much I loved her I apologized for all the things I mightve done in my lifetime to upset her and the phone hung up I then called my father I told him how much I loved him I told him to tell my brothers I love them and I said my last goodbyes she testified She also spoke about emerging from the school and finding a friend and her mom They called the police over and they began picking body matter from my hair Kavanaugh will not be in the hearing room Friday but has testified that violence in schools is something we all detest Democrats have pushed him on an opinion he wrote in on gun control Kavanaugh dissented from a majority opinion of the DC Circuit that upheld a ban that applied to semiautomatic rifles in the District of Columbia He relied on Supreme Court precedent and wrote that the Court had held that handguns the vast majority of which today are semiautomatic are constitutionally protected because they have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by lawabiding citizens During his testimony he acknowledged that people passionately disagree with the Supreme Courts precedent But that as a lower court judge Im following all the precedent He said that in his opinion he explained in painstaking detail why he thought the test he applied in the case was appropriate And he said that the Supreme Court opinion allowed a lot of gun regulation machine guns can be banned he said as well as laws prohibiting possession by the people with mental illness and in government buildings and schools He spoke about growing up in the Washington DC area that has been plagued by in the s and s plagued by gang and gun drug violence and its known for a while as the murder capital of the world Eastmond advised senators As you make your final decision think about it as if you had to justify and defend your choice to those who we lost to gun violence If Kavanaugh doesnt even have the decency to shake hands with a father of a victim he definitely wont have the decency to make life changing decisions that affect real people,parkland survivor details her experience during shooting at kavanaugh hearing The woman described being dragged by an unidentified stranger into the basement of a house and pushed against a wall and then punched her exboyfriend on Monday One of the assailants and the womans family members were present when the attack turned deadly she told the Daily News The woman said the attacker and the womans family members held hands as if she was a child the Associated Press reported,the scene at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla where a student was killed in february The student died after being knocked from behind by an assailant who had shot him multiple times According to police an initial investigation turned up no more than in cash A second investigation led by a former college student who was also a witness showed that the suspect was also a coworker near a liquor store on the northwest,0
Joaquin Olivers th birthday was celebrated with a surprise party a gathering of nearly friends and family who packed his house in Florida Born in Venezuela he had just received his American citizenship He was about to begin his senior year of high school A year later his friends and family stood outside the National Rifle Association headquarters in Fairfax County Virginia surrounded by hundreds of protesters and sang Happy Birthday through waves of tears Joaquin was one of the people killed in a February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida His th birthday would have been Saturday I dont know what the right way is to celebrate today said his sister Andrea Ghersi after the crowd had dispersed Theres nothing I can do that will make today feel okay He should have been here He should be here The birthday tribute served as the emotional climax to a rally that brought hundreds to the doorstep of the NRA demanding stricter gun laws and the revocation of the gun groups nonprofit status They were met with dozens of counterprotesters some of whom arrived with guns strapped to their hips or across their chests The protest which was organized by a coalition of antigunviolence organizations included survivors of gun violence from around the country though the headliners were students from Stoneman Douglas They have been touring the country registering young people to vote and raising awareness about gun violence Organizers who dubbed the protest the National March on the NRA said they were there for multiple reasons to confront the NRA and condemn the lobbying efforts of the group and to make demands of local and federal lawmakers who may be watching Their demands include instituting universal background checks of gun buyers through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and banning highcapacity magazines and any weapon of a caliber higher than caliber or more and any rifle long gun or shortbarreled rifle that fires in semiautomatic and takes selfloading magazines according to a website for the march They also called for a searchable database of gun owners through the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives The NRA did not respond to a request for comment Though police separated the groups placing thick orange barricades and a chunk of space between them several activists said they came to Saturdays rally to engage the other side and have a conversation When youre just yelling at each other nothing is going to change and no one is going to change their minds said Lindsey Nystrom who carried a sign listing NRA contributions to prominent Republican lawmakers Its such a different energy when you take the time to really listen and have a conversation Thats why we came today Thats what we wanted She and her sister Grace Nystrom spent much of the day speaking to NRA members and gun owners who milled around on their side of the barricades Wade Guzman of Aberdeen Maryland had similar motivations he wanted to engage people on the other side of the gun debate So he stood with the student protesters and their supporters refusing to move to the other side of the barricades where his fellow progun activists were corralled With his mm gun strapped to his hip Guzman greeted passersby with a smile and a handdrawn sign that challenged people to disarm their expectations and assumptions Though hes a gun owner Guzman is not a member of the NRA He grew up near Parkland and felt personally affected by the attack on students there But he said he doesnt believe stricter gun laws will fix the problem We can find middle ground if we work together and see past what we assume about each other he said People look at me and they think they know all about who I am and what I believe But they would probably never guess that my parents came here illegally from Guatemala my sister is married to a black woman I personally disagree with the Muslim ban theres a lot you can learn when you just talk to people Guzman said Im here because Im trying to hear them Im trying to be sensitive and help them hear me too he said Several counterprotesters said they support better enforcement of existing gun laws broader mentalhealth checks and safety training for gun owners But they dismissed attacks on specific firearms such as the AR which was used in the Parkland attack Despite the occasional heated exchange the event remained peaceful Fairfax County police Lt Eli Cory said one arrest was made A man crossing from the counterprotesters side was charged with unlawfully crossing a police barrier Similar sister marches took place in nearly two dozen cities where marchers were expected to target local guns groups or state legislatures Outside the NRA headquarters a pile of sunflowers was left beside a mural that Joaquins father Manuel Oliver created to honor his slain son He had painted the teens face framed by small flames and the words We demand to blow out our candles Then with a hammer he struck a hole through each flame blowing them out,outside nra headquarters protesters honor slain parkland teen on his th birthday As the crowd surged forward a handful of protesters shouted and sang in front of a large glass wall in front of the building that houses the citys tallest hotel chain One woman a yearold named Amanda Cordero said she had

the shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla on saturday You can say that some people are just doing a take a picture but in a city like Detroit they dont have their own flags

FORT LAUDERDALE Fla The sheriff leading the state commission investigating Floridas high school massacre says he now believes trained volunteer teachers should have access to guns so they can stop shooters who get past other safeguards In this June file photo Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission chair and Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri gestures as he speaks during a commission meeting in Sunrise Fla Guiltieri says he now believes trained volunteer teachers should have access to guns so they can stop shooters who get past other safeguards AP PhotoWilfredo Lee File Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri chairman of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission said he will ask the panel to recommend state law be changed so teachers who undergo background checks and extensive training will be allowed to have guns on campus as a last line of defense Its a proposal that both the state teachers union and PTA oppose Gualtieri told The Associated Press this week he long believed only law enforcement personnel should carry guns at school but his position morphed after studying other shootings and watching security video of the Feb Stoneman Douglas attack which left students and three staff members dead He said it gnaws at him that suspect Nikolas Cruz stopped firing five times to reload his AR semiautomatic rifle but no teacher or other school employee could use those pauses to shoot Cruz The athletic director and a coach both unarmed died trying to stop Cruz and at least one teacher minutes later would have had a clear shot Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox Meanwhile video shows the Broward County sheriffs deputy assigned to the school drew his gun but stayed outside By the time other law enforcement arrived the final fatal shots had been fired We know from the history of these things that the majority are stopped by school personnel Gualtieri said pointing to shootings where the gunman was tackled or disarmed by a teacher or campus employee People need to keep an open mind to it as the reality is that if someone else in that school had a gun it could have saved kids lives After the shooting Florida law was changed to allow school districts to train and arm employees other than teachers including administrators librarians and custodians Teachers are barred unless they are former or current police officers current members of the military or Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps instructors Thirteen of the states countywide districts adopted the program mostly in rural parts of the state Currently teachers in states can carry firearms according to the Crime Prevention Research Center a conservative nonprofit organization District approval is required in most states and restrictions and training requirements vary Both the Florida Education Association which is the state teachers union and the Florida PTA oppose arming teachers saying having more guns on campus will make schools more dangerous not less Teachers should not be acting as armed security guards The majority of our members dont want to be armed they know it would be impractical and dangerous union spokeswoman Joni Branch said Angie Gallo the state PTAs legislation chair said only law enforcement should carry guns on campus Teachers need to teach Gallo said Their job is not to secure our schools It is not to shoot at shooters Other members of Gualtieris commission including Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd have expressed support for arming teachers although it is unclear if a majority agrees The panel members appointed by Gov Rick Scott and legislative leaders include law enforcement education and mental health professionals a legislator and the fathers of two slain students The panel which has been meeting periodically since April must file its initial report to Scott incoming Gov Ron DeSantis and the Legislature by Jan It will consider proposals for adoption at its midDecember meeting Other proposed recommendations include preventing outside attacks by limiting and staffing entrances allowing all school employees to order a lockdown improving campus communication systems and tightening laws governing the assessment of students who may pose a threat For law enforcement the proposals include giving officers clear orders that they must confront active shooters even if they are alone and making sure first responders from different agencies have radios that can quickly be programmed to communicate with each other Cruz now has pleaded not guilty but his lawyers have said he would plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty,sheriff leading parkland shooting probe supports arming teachers bob gualtieri says teachers who

At first I was very skeptical because we have been trained to think when people talk about suicide that its nothing more than a veiled attempt to take away our guns said Clark Aposhian chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council the states biggest gunrights lobbying group Then I checked the data Aposhian was drawn into the issue in when Steve Eliason a Republican member of the Utah House of Representatives asked for his support on a campaign to curb suicides The pitch included some alarming statistics Utah had one of the countrys highest suicide rates and half of them were by firearm Of all of the states firearmrelated deaths percent were suicides Aposhian joined the Utah Suicide Prevention Coalition which has developed literature to distribute at gun shops produced videos and created a suicideprevention training module for concealedcarry training courses Were to the point now where we felt it would be a disservice and inappropriate to our membership to not let them know whats going on in Utah and across the nation Aposhian said The Utah partnership has trickled down to communities all over the state including Washington County where Rowdy Reeves range is and where nearly half of all households own at least one firearm and many children grow up handling them The suicide rate there is twice the national rate Let our news meet your inbox The news and stories that matters delivered weekday mornings This site is protected by recaptcha We want to work with the gun owners instead of against them said Teresa Willie the countys suicide prevention coordinator She oversees a campaign that includes publiceducation efforts at churches schools and law enforcement agencies and running public service announcements on firearms and suicide before films at the local theater We dont want to polarize the community at all she said Suicide prevention coordinator Teresa Willie at the Southwest Behavioral Health Center in St George Utah Isaac Brekken for NBC News Reeve sought Willie out after the suicide at his range in early She visited the range and taught his workers how to identify warning signs from customers who could be suicidal and how to help them As Reeve listened he felt a deepening sense of responsibility If we are going to be selling these things then we should also offer people help if they have any problems he said HOW THE MOVEMENT SPREAD The affiliation between the gun industry and public health advocates has its roots in New Hampshire where in April a gun shop owner named Ralph Demicco found out that three people in one week had killed themselves using guns bought at his store The news shook him he considered himself a socially responsible business owner and was cautious about selling firearms to people who seemed risky drunk on drugs agitated inexperienced He was already a member of the New Hampshire Firearms Safety Coalition which pressed gunsafety issues I was bewildered I didnt know what to do Demicco recalled One of his colleagues from the coalition asked if he would help in a new suicide prevention effort driven by research that identified guns as a major risk factor not because gun owners were more suicidal than anyone else but because suicide is often impulsive and guns are an effective means of death Suicide prevention advocates needed Demicco because they knew gun owners would trust him more than they would public health officials Demicco agreed and together they created The Gun Shop Project distributing posters to retailers with tips on how to spot and help people who appear suicidal The Gun Shop Project has since spread to more states including Utah and there are similar partnerships in about others according to the Harvard Injury Control Research Center Some are homegrown Others are the result of a joint venture by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the National Shooting Sports Foundation an industry trade group that distributes suicide prevention toolkits to retailers and ranges Its a chance to overturn myths about suicide in the gunowning community said Bill Brassard Jr a National Shooting Sports Foundation spokesman DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS BUT YOUVE GOT TO HAVE THEM Among those myths according to researchers is that if someone wants to end his or her life but doesnt have access to a gun the person will find another way Researchers say that making it more difficult for someone who is suicidal to access a planned means of death can buy time until the suicidal thoughts subside That is particularly important in the case of guns which they say are present in about a third of American homes and are the most lethal method of suicide About percent of suicide attempts with a firearm end in death while drug overdoses the most common method of suicide attempts are fatal in less than percent of cases according to researchers at the Harvard Injury Research Control Center The importance of education in talking to gun owners is not saying they shouldnt own guns and it has nothing to do with the Second Amendment said Marian Betz an associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and cofounder of the Colorado Firearm Safety Coalition which has adopted the Gun Shop Project and National Shooting Sports Foundation programs Its saying Sometimes we get so sad we cant think straight so how can we make things safer for you Jacquelyn Clark owner of the Bristlecone Shooting Training and Retail Center in Denver and a member of Colorados firearm safety coalition redoubled her efforts after a firsttime customer shot himself at her range two years ago Clark revamped her staff training and offered more customereducation literature from suicide hotlines to gunstorage tips She sought advice from other gun shops adopting some of their rules including a prohibition against new customers using the range alone without a recommendation from a family member colleague or friend The staff now looks more closely at new customers and regulars by examining eye contact attention to safety briefings and whether they seem in a rush Clarks staff turns away more people now Employees once asked a regular customer upset because his wife had left him to come back another day They once asked a new customer who was alone and seemed to want to rush through a handgun purchase for a personal reference instead he left Some of these people leave angry Some may not be dangerous to themselves or anyone else But the cost of lost business is a price Clark said shes willing to pay These can be difficult conversations but youve got to have them Clark said A GUN INSTRUCTORS MISSION In the city of Loretto in rural centralsouth Tennessee firearms instructor Matt Holt sees those uncomfortable conversations as a personal crusade Four years ago Holt learned that one of his closest friends had taken his own life with a gun That motivated Holt to work with the Tennessee Suicide Prevention Network to persuade the state to require a suicide module in the state curriculum for handgun carrypermit training The change went into effect July When Holt teaches the hour course he starts the suicide section by telling his students about his friend and other friends and family members including his mother who have tried to kill themselves I try to engage them to get them talking about it Really talking Holt said He tells them about the signs of suicide what to say to someone who exhibits them and how to find a safe place for their guns He knows his openness makes him an exception in the gun community He wants the curriculum to include videos on suicide prevention he says because a lot of instructors still dont feel comfortable with suicide either ITS GOT TO HELP Last year a man in his s walked into Rowdys Range Shooter Supply and asked to speak with someone in charge Reeve and his two coowners came to the desk and began chatting with him Im suicidal the man said He wanted help in keeping himself away from guns He asked them to take his picture share it with their staff and tell them that if he returned and inquired about renting a gun to refuse By then Reeve had become trained to teach a suicide prevention course and was no longer unnerved by such conversations He and his partners quickly agreed to the mans request They kept chatting for about minutes before the man shook their hands and thanked them He said he hoped he wouldnt see them again He hasnt Last Reeve heard the man was doing fine We tell our staff not to see our customers as customers but as a person Spend time to talk to them what brings them in today get to know them Reeve said Im a firm believer that if we can get out there and teach these classes and spread the firearms safety word its got to help If you or someone you know is in crisis call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at text TALK to or visit SpeakingOfSuicidecomresources for additional resources,more than americans a year kill themselves with a gun alarmed gun sellers are joining the suicide prevention fight The law would prevent Americans from purchasing guns based on race religion sex age or other considerations For

As statehouses across the country approach the end of their legislative sessions in the coming weeks advocates on either side of the gun debate are pushing hard to get their measures across the finish line Already some states including Florida and Vermont have passed measures to toughen access to firearms though its hard to know if others will follow suit Many proposed bills could just be left dangling when the sessions end in the spring and early summer ,how many states will pass guncontrol laws before recess It will take many years to enact a solution especially if new polls suggest that some legislators support some measure As far as what percentage of Americans have supported these laws to date It probably remains much much lower We still want that debate to continue before November but there needs to be at least some chance of the issue being an issue that divides Americans,gov rick scott of florida center at the state capitol in washington in may The state capitol in washington in May Photo Associated Press file photo Gov Chris Baker signs a bill that allows the capitol to issue a single license for persons of interest over a period of days Photo Bill Haddad the Associated Press WASHINGTON Gov Chris Baker signed a ,0

According to the Washington Posts data on school shootings more than students have experienced gun violence since the killings at Columbine High School in And that number doesnt even include teachers and other school workers To understand what its like to survive a school shooting and then return to the classroom as an adult I spoke with three educators who have experienced gun violence in their schools Heather Martin is currently a high school English teacher in Aurora Colorado but on April she was a senior at Columbine High School where people were shot to death The shooting began while she was in choir class Mary Ann Jacob was a library clerk at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Connecticut when children and six adult staff members were fatally shot in It was a Friday morning and Mary Ann remembers that those mornings were often reserved for short dance parties to celebrate the end of the week As she prepared for a library class with a group of fourthgraders she heard noises coming over the schools intercom Ken Yuers is a fourth and fifthgrade teacher at Rancho Tehama Elementary School in Northern California He recalls that the shooting spree began on Nov The gunman ultimately fled the school and later shot and killed himself as police closed in on him Listen by clicking the arrow on the audio player below or via Apple Podcasts Stitcher Google Play Overcast or TuneIn An edited transcript of the conversation follows The Stories Heather Martin A student ran up through the doors and just said Someone has a gun downstairs and theyre shooting We all kind of immediately jumped up probably out of shock and the teacher yelled at us Get down So we kind of sat down and then the gunfire erupted right outside the doorway So a bunch of people scattered I did not scatter Im not really sure why I think I just was in shock and didnt want to overreact Definitely not thinking that this could happen at my school Theres a chance I went outside to investigate what was happening A friend of mine says that we went outside the door where we saw Mr Sanders take a bullet I dont have any memory of that but we did come back into the choir room and eventually barricaded ourselves into the teachers office We put the two desks in front of the door There were about of us barricaded in there for three hours So we heard the gunfire happening in the library which is where most of the murders took place And after three hours we heard a knock at the door and we all looked at each other like what should we do One of the students was like Who is it Denver SWAT team open the door So we moved the desks and came flying out the door We couldnt get out of there fast enough From there they did question us and search us And then led us out of the school in groups of The gunman had a lot of pipe bombs that they had set off throughout the building So the fire alarm was going off the sprinklers were on I remember walking through water and when I was walking through the commons that was very surreal It was empty but there were water and backpacks and paper plates floating on the water It was eerily quiet I often think about theI dont know why it reminds me of this its kind of gruesomebut the scene in the movie Titanic with all the bodies sort of just like floating in this water It wasnt bodies it was backpacks and things There were chairs that were melted because of the bombsand then they hadnt covered the bodies yet So we did see the bodies on the way out Mary Ann Jacob I thought What are they doing in the office Could they have hit the button by mistake while theyre fooling around having their Dance Party Friday So I got up and walked over to the circulation desk and picked up the phone and called down there to let them know we could hear them and I start hearing some loud noises but its not really making any sense And from under her desk one of the school secretaries picks up the phone and says Theres shooting And I hung up the phone without even responding Yelled to Yvonne Cech who is our librarian Lockdown and I ran out into the hallway to the two classrooms across the hall from us and yelled Lockdown in their doors and slammed their doors shut And when I got back to the library Yvonne was ushering the kids to the spot along the wall that backed up to the hallway in between two bookcases where we had practiced our lockdown drills and there were two other adults in the room I said What happened And she said to me Its the worst thing this countrys seen since Columbine Mary Ann Jacob Sandy Hook Elementary We put some bookcases around us and waited looking at each other the adults We were sort of spread out among the kids looking at each other like were thinking What is going on I mean clearly at that point we could tell they were gunshots It was Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom And even hearing all that the reality of it just wasnt sinking in A few minutes go by and we thought we had locked all our doors There were five separate doors in the library We hear a door open and I look up and I see the barrel of a shotgun come around the corner And honestly we all thought it was the gunman but very quickly realized it was the first policeman whod come in the building His head came around the corner He looked at me and said something and I said something in response I dont know what And he put his finger to his lips to tell us to be quiet and turned around and left And Yvonne went over to check the door again and we realized it wasnt locking properly Were still thinking were in grave danger So we instruct the kids to crawl along the floor to a closet And then we closed the door and pushed two filing cabinets in front of it and waited So we heard a guy yell Police so we made him shove his badge under the door and then we pulled the file cabinets out of the way and I opened the door And standing outside the room where we were in was a room full of police in riot gear and I sort of crumpled at that moment thinking Oh my God its real Whatevers going on is really bad And I said to the police What do you want us to do And theyre like We want you to come out two by two and an adult will take each child in each hand and well exit the building And I remember thinking that I had to compose my face before I turned around to face the kids and so I did and said to them OK guys the police are here theyre ready to take us out When we emerged from the library the hallway was lined with police in riot gear with their guns drawn like there was a very present danger And we ran out of the building I remember getting to the firehouse which was adjacent to our school and the kids just sort of melted out of my hands I dont remember what happened to them and the first selectman and some people were standing there and I said What happened And she said to me Its the worst thing this countrys seen since Columbine Ken Yuers This man in our community of people had murdered his wife the evening of the th and wed come to find out later cut open up the floorboards of his home and put her body in there and he had been feuding with his neighbors So the next morning about am he shot a couple and stole a truck and began a rampage in the community So for me I was at the school office trying to arrange a meeting with a parent and then I was on my way toward the classroom I was between the quad in my classroom and I stopped to talk to the head of yard duty Patty Smith and we were talking and we heard a series of gunshots about a quarter mile away rapid fire and Patty said to me We may need to get these kids inside I did my best army crawl toward the phone and said Lord forgive me for my sins because the phone was right by the ramp where the shooter was Ken Yuers Rancho Tehama Elementary School I proceeded westward toward my classroom I was walking very fast just heightened alert and we got them lined up I got the door open A couple of kids looked really scared and I was getting them inside And I said Hey did you see someone He said I saw a guy with a gun And then the gate crashed and not all the students were in the door yet some of them were on the ramp They looked and they saw this guy with a gun and they let out a bigyou could just hear an audible gasp And I kept standing there at that door Come on get inside And they did And Get under your desks They knew what to do They were experienced with a lockdown And then I did my best army crawl toward the phone and said loud enough Lord forgive me for my sins because the phone was right by the ramp and I picked it up and I called and I couldnt get out So I called my daughters grandmother and I told her Hey we have an active shooter at Rancho Tehama Elementary Call active shooter at Rancho Tehama Elementary call and hung up the phone And the kids were whimpering I just repeated Our eyes are our ears we need to remain calm Fortunately Mr May and Mrs Smith and the custodian and the teachers were now getting out too and the secretary everybody got those kids inside So by the time he came around the corner they were all inside which was pivotal because this man went around shooting at the quad area He started in Room where Ms Bauman was Her Lock Blok was malfunctioning so she was holding it with her body trying to pull that door closed with all of her strength And then Room where Mrs Almand and Mrs Smith and Mr May were And then he continued on toward the office Just opened up on there where the secretary and the custodian were and then continued on toward the eastern part of the quad the library shot the kindergarten and firstgrade classrooms where a bullet did get a student a yearold And a lot of the students were injured by flying glass but we were lucky According to the school officials he fired off about a hundred rounds on that campus We were extremely lucky God help that community I mean five people died but the shots going off were enough to alert us to get those kids inside The Conversation Dahlia Lithwick Hearing these stories provides a jarring look at what we ask of teachers in America They also remind me of a piece I wrote for Slate back in about active shooter drills in our nations schools and their unintended consequences of making children anxious and worried My own son during an active shooter drill at his school was told to run like a pack of wild dogs is chasing you Do you think lockdown drills are a good thing or not Mary Ann Jacob Whats happening today just five years later than what happened in Sandy Hook is different When we did lockdown drills before we would say to the kids This is in the event that theres a stray dog or a bear so were just making sure that were safe Today its all about an active shooter and every kid in America knows that Were traumatizing kids today in a vastly different way who havent actually experienced gun violence themselves but are acutely aware of how much danger theyre in I mean school has always been a safe haven for kids and its not anymore Ive got my plan and Ive got my backup plan and I have a backup plan for my backup plan And part of being a survivor is really going through those whatifs Heather Martin Columbine High School Dahlia Lithwick Heather you actually are teaching protocols I know that you clearly feel that its better to be forearmed with knowledge and a plan than to just be shocked How do you finesse it when you teach it so that youre not essentially terrifying the kids youre trying to protect Heather Martin Well there are a couple factors here One is I teach seniors so theyre years old so I think its really different talking to those students than it would be talking to younger students Im very upfront and honest about my story and I tell my story to my students every year And with my students many of them have experienced gun violence in their lives Theres a lot of gang activity And I also have a lot of students who are refugees who are fleeing civil war So the trauma from a red lockdown well they hear my story and they can sort of they can imagine it happening I dont notice that my kids are that impacted by the drills As a matter of fact even the real lockdowns that we hadwe had a student shot outside and then we had a student with a gun in the building For me I do like to be prepared given what Ive been through Ive got my plan and Ive got my backup plan and I have a backup plan for my backup plan And part of being a survivor is really going through those whatifs Mary Ann Jacob I do the same thing I mean I have a lot of plans for emergency situations and they go well beyond what the school has put together because we know that sometimes what the school puts together is inadequate Ken Yuers I am onboard with that Ive prepared thinking about what could happen not only at the school but when Im away from school after going through November Dahlia Lithwick One thing that we keep hearing after events like this is just how much confusion there is in the momentfrom confusion around the number of shooters confusion about who the victims are their names what happened It seems like all these years after Columbine we would be better on these communications and protocols Heather Martin I think sort of to your question is law enforcements response When we were first busted out of that room and we came flying out of there we were cussed at We were searched and not nicely and they were yelling and it was loud Its a very highstress situation I also learned that when they saved us they thought that there were still four gunmen on the loose Because again initial reports were that there were six They did find two in the library Obviously they were deceased then The two on the roof were the air conditioning repair guys so theyre still thinking that there are two gunmen on the loose When they cleared our room they searched us Im sort of circling the issue here but I think we do learn stuff from every situation and I know that at least the law enforcement conferences that Ive been to and that Ive spoken to theyre really working on their response to these things Not just tactically but also how to minimize the trauma of the people who are going through these situations Dahlia Lithwick Youre all describing I think PTSD right Some version of The way I make sense of this and go forward in the world is to just be hyperaware of the world around me Part of whats so difficult is that I guess all of your students in the aggregate have some version of that too right Ken Yuers It made for a very surreal year because this happened in November It was the first onethird of the year We had twothirds of the year left to finish Theres the combination of having a class of traumatized kids and also youre an educator Youre there to help kids advance and learn be successful in life be part of their community locally nationally and here you are just now focused and the district backed us on this on their mental health That had to come first And you have to keep reminding yourself these kids have to start rebuilding their mental health It just made for a very very different year trying to process it all Heather Martin I just wanted to commend you guys for that because as a senior I know it was different because we graduated and sort of moved on but one of my biggest struggles was not having that system of support as I went off to college I did try college I dropped out There was a fire alarm and I lost it So its really nice to hear that your district was supportive Ken Yuers And we have a great staff Every teacher and staff they didnt have a sick day the rest of the year which to me is justwe were there for the kids because thats as you know thats why we do what we do It was an exhausting year Sometimes before I went in that classroom I would be in that staff room just trying to get myself together Ken Yuers Rancho Tehama Elementary School Mary Ann Jacob The adults were just so traumatized too but nobody could imagine allowing the kids to go back without being there for them because they needed us as much as we needed to be with each other But the amount of learning that went on the rest of the year was far below what would have occurred and every day you encountered something with a student that you were wholly unprepared to deal with And I remember sitting at my computer one day and swiping a girls ID to check out a book and her picture came up She said Oh that was before Ms Soto died who was her teacher who died I said I know honey Thats so hard Because we had children yearolds who survived in the two classrooms where the shooters were who ran by him when he was killing their classmates It meant again putting aside our own grief and trauma every day I mean Ken you were probably exhausted the rest of the year Im guessing Ken Yuers Yes it was an exhausting year but as I said we were there for the kids And sometimes before I went in that classroom I would be in that staff room just trying to get myself together before Id leave to go do it and thats where the support from other staff members was great because everybody could relate to what you had gone through You werent alone in the experience Dahlia Lithwick And two of you have talked about having to kind of compose your face and compose your voice and what it feels like in this moment of extreme crisis to have to almost put on a mask When youre reliving this and thinking about it this question of How did I hold it together for these kidsthat must be such a huge part something you probably didnt think you had in you right Ken Yuers Oh yeah Its surreal And yes I didnt know I had it in me I didnt know I had it in me when all of it was going down when the perpetrator was out there shooting You know inside you just want to scream and use a bunch of bad language but I have a classroom full of kids and theyre turning to you and they do turn to you And its a form of therapy for myself You cant help but grow closer to these kids after going through such an experience Mary Ann Jacob One of the things that I think we didnt do a great job of as a school community was take care of the adults in the school The focus was on getting the kids back into a normal routine and that was so important that it was done at the expense of the adults in the classroom and in the building who were basically told If you cant keep it together well get somebody else to come in And it was a year before there was help in the building for the adults Dahlia Lithwick Im so glad you said that Mary Ann because as I was listening to Ken I was thinking Its so easy to construct a story in which everybodys a hero in these moments We need to focus on heroes because it makes us feel better But I love what youre saying because what youre saying is the minute you start calling teachers heroes youre taking away a little bit of the possibility of them being in trauma and grieving themselves right Mary Ann Jacob Yeah and you know it was interesting because a lot of the people in the community and in the nationI mean there was so much attention on us like there was after Columbine the first responders are getting awards and these people are getting awards and these people while those of us who are going to school every day like Ken you know going back to the school every day and teaching those kids it was like What about them They were the first responders We were the first responders We protected those kids every day in and out and nobody wanted to be a hero but we wanted people to understand that as a community we needed their support And I think people felt like we must have been getting that support because of who we were But in fact we werent necessarily getting the kind of support we needed I remember even my own physician saying to me Well youve been through a terrible trauma you need to get help And I can remember driving away from her office that day thinking That was not helpful Because people who are most traumatized are least equipped to help themselves Dahlia Lithwick I guess that leads to the postParkland conversation which must break your hearts because youve had this conversation a thousand times before Maybe we should arm teachers and maybe we should hire veterans Is there anything of utility here What do you do when we have these conversations for the thousandth time Mary Ann Jacob Frankly I think the only person having the conversation about arming teachers is the NRA leadership and the president I think regular people in general think thats a ridiculous idea Because on a practical basis its almost unmanageable And its also the extreme You know most schools in this country have about a hundred things they can do between nothing and arming teachers that are very effective for safety and security of their students So there are a lot of things we should be doing to make our schools safer Thats not one of them in my opinion Dahlia Lithwick Heather Ken I want to give you an opportunity if youre proponents of arming teachers to rebut what Mary Ann just said or just to reflect on what you think would be measures that would make a difference instead of this incredibly tedious thoughts and prayers conversation Ken Yuers There are a lot of things that could be done I agree and unfortunately a lot of it requires funding and here in California theyre trying to do some things to make schools safer A local assemblyman James Gallagher he tried to get it where every school had an armed security guard which thats an outrageous amount of money no way its gonna happen Speaking to the day of Nov for me I was a military policeman so I carried a sidearm for three and a half years Im not a guy who goes out and shoots for fun Ive never hunted Im not a member of the NRA But in Northern California in a rural area there is a little more Second Amendment type of thinking so because of where I live I do have a concealed weapon permit I never really thought about being armed so much at school but I will say that morning I wouldnt have thought about using the gun but I did once I got that Chromebook cart slid up against the door I was thinking Gosh if I had my sidearm on me this would be a good way to set up a defensive posture with the police so far away I think at that exact moment we have a rare exception where if youre in a rural area and there are no other protections already in placeplease get those protections in place but in the meantime you know I think it should be something at least considered I dont think itll happen in California Im a member of the California teachers union here and theyre supporting Govhe will probably be our governorGavin Newsom hes lieutenant governor right now and they asked him what he thought about arming teachers and he had a oneword response ludicrous And I get what hes saying You know teachers we want to bond with our students build a rapport we dont want to be thinking about a gun But if theres gonna be an exception I dont think any teachers should be forced to have to carry it could be strictly voluntary with intense training And when I was going to get my permit the instructor told me every bullet you potentially fire has a liability lawsuit attached to it Anyhow I dont want to come across as a gun nut I dont think I am Dahlia Lithwick Youre not Ken Yuers OK And I heard about some knucklehead whos supposed to be a police reserve or something firing off a gun in a classroom in the past year and just there should be no gun unholstered ever in a school unless youre trying to save someones life Anyways thats my thought on that Heather Martin Well I think as a teacher when were talking about arming teachers I personally would not like to carry a firearm mainly because my whatif scenarios are all the things that could go wrong and my whatif is What if I accidentally shoot one of my kids What if the gunman is a student and then I have to shoot one of my kids What if the police come looking for the gunman and here I am holding a gun There are so many whatifs in that scenario I would not feel comfortable carrying a weapon And then you know I appreciate what Ken said just about you know mandating it If somebody mandated that I carry a gun I want to be like Um I was at Columbine Like why would you want me to have a gun There are teachers out there that maybe shouldnt have scissors I dont know But I would be very careful with you know mandating that and making teachers carry guns because again especially in the community where I work people in authority with weapons thats not always a good thing Mary Ann Jacob I also come from a home that has guns My husband and sons actually spent Fathers Day at the shooting range doing skeet shooting and my husband grew up in the Midwest where the first day of hunting season was a day off from school and you know my family has always respected the Second Amendment and considers gun ownership a privilege that comes with great responsibility That being said Im not antiweapons in school but I think you know in Connecticut for example we have a law that you can have a school security its called an SSO and that position was created by the state Legislature Its part of the police department its a parttime position that is a retired police officer and they belong to the police department so they work under the authority of the police department with all the same training and our schools have those in some of our communities I think thats perfectly acceptable They man the front doors and they protect the internal community In Kens community this doesnt sound superpractical from a financial standpoint so there may be something else that has to happen But you know in many communities there are other solutions other than arming teachers I think Teachers need to focus on what they do for a living which is teach kids This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity,teachers who survived shootings at columbine sandy hook and rancho tehama discuss going back into the classroom I also get some feedback from students who have worked under similar conditions A person who was a counselor at the school told me that the classrooms were so cramped that I was forced to drive to the front of the room grab some blankets and be alone with the boy who started the shooting As you may have guessed we are at the beginning,a photograph of the sandy hook elementary school shooting in I heard the school shooting I was like This is terrible

Californias teachers retirement system will pressure retail companies it is invested in to stop selling firearms and parts that are outlawed by the state and would consider divestment from firms that refuse to make changes a key panel decided Wednesday The vote by the Investment Committee for the California State Teachers Retirement System was supported by panel member and state Treasurer John Chiang even though he had asked in October that the system take more immediate action to stop investing in the gun retailers If Congress and state houses are either unwilling or unable to pass sensible policies to stop our schoolyards work sites and places of worship from becoming killing fields then lets take the battle to where the money is Chiang a candidate for governor told the Investment Committee before the unanimous vote to adopt the engagement policy California bans the sale of assault weapons which are any semiautomatic centerfire rifle or semiautomatic pistol that lacks a fixed ammunition magazine and has any of a number of parts that include a telescoping stock The ban includes AKs and other militarystyle rifles Advertisement The new policy was drafted in the wake of mass shootings in San Bernardino and Orlando Fla and more recently at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Fla where a gunman killed students and faculty in February CalSTRS move follows recent actions by several Wall Street firms including the nations largest money manager to employ their financial heft to push for stricter gun laws BlackRock Inc with trillion of assets under management plans to remove the stocks of retailers that sell firearms from some of its existing and planned investment funds And Citigroup Inc said it would place restrictions on firearms sales for its new retail business clients including a requirement that they dont sell guns to someone who hasnt passed a background check or is under Advertisement Chiang said he and legislators also will pursue a bill to force the larger California Public Employees Retirement System to adopt a faster action plan that would eliminate investment in gun sellers that fail to change by July The policy adopted Wednesday by CalSTRS does not include deadlines for engagement to result in changes The teachers board voted to hire two fulltime employees to try to persuade companies it is invested in to stop selling assault rifles If that doesnt work the retirement system officials will use their proxy voting authority to vote against all members of the companys governing board If those two steps fail CalSTRS would initiate a review process under the new policy to determine whether it should divest from a company and whether that would hurt its ability to pay pension benefits Advertisement CalSTRS billion investment portfolio includes more than million in holdings in Walmart Inc Kroger Co and other firms that it contends sell firearms outside California that are banned in the state according to a staff report However the staff report submitted to the board said the two main companies are already making changes Kroger has indicated it is going to responsibly phase out sales of firearms and ammunition and both it and Walmart have raised the age limit for gun purchases to the report said In Walmart stopped selling guns it considered assault rifles including weapons that accept highcapacity ammunition magazines Advertisement On Wednesday Walmart spokesman Casey Staheli said that decision satisfied CalSTRS latest demands We stopped selling modern sporting rifles in he said Walmart and Kroger took their latest actions after Dicks Sporting Goods banned gun sales to customers under at its Dicks stores and Field Stream outlets and stopped selling assaultstyle weapons at Field Stream following the Florida high school shooting The decision by Dicks one of the nations largest sporting goods retailers drew praise at the time from Harry M Keiley chairman of the Investment Committee and a high school teacher with the Santa MonicaMalibu Unified School District Classrooms are meant to be sacred spaces for our children to learn and grow where fear and violence have absolutely no place and will not be tolerated he said Advertisement There isnt uniform agreement though at CalSTRS that divestment works Christopher Ailman chief investment officer of CalSTRS said at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills this month that divesting ends any influence an investor might have Divestment hasnt made the world a better place he said Also attending the conference was Vicki Fuller chief investment officer of the New York State Common Retirement Fund the third largest public pension plan in the nation who had the same take Advertisement If we divest we dont have a place at the table and we dont change behavior Fuller said We do need our companies to be thinking long term about how they are going to be able to continue to generate their earnings But on Wednesday the CalSTRS panel heard emotional testimony from current and former teachers who said they have been shaken by the spread of campus gun violence CalSTRS has an obligation to engage corporate executives to try to make changes in business practices that reduce gun violence Keiley said Im under no illusion that actions that we take today or into the future will end these horrific acts of murder at the hands of people who are mentally ill using assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill other human beings Keiley said during the board hearing Advertisement But to sit back and say that we have done enough that theres nothing else we can do I believe would be a breach of our fiduciary duty he added CalSTRS has taken action before in response to gun violence After the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut the teachers retirement system adopted a divestment policy for companies that manufacture firearms that are banned in the state Bloomberg and Times staff writer James F Peltz contributed to this report Advertisement patrickmcgreevy com Twitter ,calstrs to pressure retailers to stop selling assault weapons banned by

Among the thousands of immigrants who have been coming across the USMexico border in recent months many are seeking to escape gang and drug violence raging in their homelands The weapon of choice used to intimidate them Often an Americanmade gun While the flow of drugs and immigrants into the US has been welldocumented for decades and become a regular part of the political debate what is often overlooked is how gangs and drug cartels exploit weaknesses at the border to smuggle guns from the US into Latin America A report by the University of San Diego says the number of firearms smuggled from the United States was so significant that nearly half of American gun dealers rely on that business to stay afloat On average an estimated firearms each year are purchased in the United States expressly to be sent to Mexico the report said the vast majority of the sales originating in the border states of California Texas New Mexico and Arizona Once in Mexico the weapons end up in the hands of drug cartels or get shipped to gangs in Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador countries that are dealing with an epidemic of gun violence Armed holdups on public transportation are a regular occurrence in Honduras where nearly half of the unregistered weapons originated in the US the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives reported in recent years Gun violence in El Salvador is so rampant that the country has been averaging more than one shootout a day between police and gangs this year said Ricardo Sosa a criminologist specializing in gangs and security in El Salvador In every one of these operations police are able to seize between two and six firearms at the scene he said That is one of the indicators that the gangs are armed on many occasions with long guns and short guns for each one of their members Mexico last year recorded its highest number of murders in nearly two decades with more than people killed higher than even during the countrys drug war in It continues unabated with an average of people killed each day in the first five months of this year The bloodshed in Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador has been a big driver of immigration into the US with the government saying nearly families came across the border in August alone many of them from those three countries Guncontrol groups contend that the US government is essentially exporting gang violence to Latin America with permissive gun laws which in turn creates an immigration crisis along the border If the Trump administration were serious about wanting to stop refugees from fleeing violence in Latin America and Mexico to come north they would be doing something about the southward gun trafficking that is fueling a lot of that migration said Adam Skaggs chief counsel with the Giffords Law Center Gunrights activists say the issue is overblown and mischaracterized The National Rifle Association and other gunrights groups contend the most effective way to combat the problem is not with stricter gun laws but by eradicating drug cartels and other criminal enterprises They say the numbers are inflated and that the industry has proactively sought to educate licensed gun dealers on how to detect straw purchases in which a firearm is bought expressly to give it to someone who otherwise would not be able to legally own a gun Obviously Mexico has a huge problem with rampant corruption that clearly cannot be blamed on the US the NRA said in a position paper on the issue in At the same time Mexico has extremely prohibitive gun laws yet has far worse crime than the US Under the Obama administration federal authorities launched an operation dubbed Fast and Furious that allowed criminals to buy firearms with the intention of tracking them to criminal organizations But the ATF lost most of the guns including two that were found at the scene of a slaying of a US Border Patrol agent In gun dealers along the border states were required to report to the ATF anytime someone purchased two or more semiautomatic long guns in a fiveday period President Donald Trump issued an executive order in as his response to gun trafficking directing federal agencies to ramp up prosecution aimed at going after foreign criminals and to improve coordination among federal agencies along the border Nabbing the guns at the border is a challenge on several levels They arent as detectable as drug shipments and they can be disassembled and loaded with legal goods making their way from the US The effectiveness of this kind of gun smuggling still remains very high It doesnt take a whole lot said David Shirk one of the University of San Diego reports authors Experts say a big reason gun trafficking remains one of the hot commodities flowing from the United States into Latin America is profit Retired ATF agent Bernard Zapor noted that an ARplatform firearm that sells retail in the US for can fetch more than in Mexico A box of ammo that might go for just under could command Theyre not buying grandpas old shotgun thats been lying around and found in a shed Zapor said Theyre buying brand new Colt ARs Associated Press writer Marcos Aleman contributed to this report

WASHINGTON The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear a Second Amendment challenge to a California law that imposes a day waiting period on firearms purchases As is their custom the justices gave no reasons for deciding not to hear the case The court has turned away many Second Amendment cases in recent years to the frustration of gunrights groups and some conservative justices Justice Clarence Thomas filed an impassioned page dissent in the case Silvester v Becerra No As evidenced by our continued inaction in this area he wrote the Second Amendment is a disfavored right in this court In in District of Columbia v Heller the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep guns at home for selfdefense,justices wont hear case on waiting period for gun purchases Gov Greg Abbott called the legislature ridiculously progressive and out of step with who the American people areAs we move forward the governor said Thursday it is incumbent upon the legislature to have a truly progressive group approach this issue not out of anger and disappointment at a legislature that refuses to pass important legislation protecting our right to bear armsWe should all remember that this is not a debate about,the supreme court on tuesday declined to hear a case that would have a day waiting period on guns So for the foreseeable future guns will be available But what about the children Many people in the armed services see the idea as the latest expression of the militarys growing distrust of parents and parents ability to handle their childrens lives through physical force After all children are only supposed to be able to tell what the military and other agencies will do to them,1

Sometimes the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a hockey puck Thats the theory at Oakland University in Auburn Hills Michigan where faculty members are being trained to fight school shooters using among other things hockey pucks OU Police Chief Mark Gordon told local station WDIVTV the pucks are being given to teachers and students to throw at school shooters and cause a distraction Gordon knows something of which he speaks As a former youth hockey coach he told the Detroit News he was once hit in the head with a puck It caused a fair amount of damage to me he said Hockey pucks are perfect for defense he said though he acknowledged he knows of no research on using pucks in active shooter situations Theyre heavy enough to cause damage and compact enough to be carried in backpacks but arent considered weapons by law enforcement Anything that you can throw thats heavy and will cause damage cause injury is the bottom line of what youre trying to do Gordon said according to the Detroit Free Press A hockey puck was just a thing that was suggested that could possibly work especially when you have or people in a classroom and they all throw hockey pucks at the same time it would be quite the distraction Faculty member Garry J Gilbert admitted he was skeptical about the puck plan My first reaction was You are talking about facing an assault weapon and asking us to fight back with hockey pucks It sounded silly Gilbert told the Detroit News Then I went through the training session and it all made sense None of us want to face an armed assailant Students will look to us for leadership in a situation like that The training encourages the faculty to flee if possible and hide if not If we have to do that fight Chief Gordon has shown us you can surprise or disarm an assailant with an object Grab anything youve got a stapler or book anything youve got and be prepared and charge him Gilbert said Maybe he can be distracted by having things thrown at him and you can limit injuries and loss of life It won me over It also won over the universitys chapter of the American Association of University Professors which is distributing hockey pucks to its members and students according to WDIVTV The union is selling hockey pucks to raise funds to equip all campus classroom doors with locks that can be used without leaving the room in the event of an emergency The unending wave of mass shootings targeting students also is prompting other ideas that dont involve firearms Pennsylvanias Blue Mountain School District in March equipped all of its classrooms with a fivegallon bucket of rocks Anyone attempting a school shooting the superintendent said will be stoned Meanwhile sales of bulletproof backpacks reportedly are soaring Also on HuffPost Sophie Guite View photos Sophie Guite of Winterport Maine was arrested for spousal abuse after allegedly hitting her husband with a spatula More Joel Parrish View photos Parrish was accused in June of beating another man with his own prosthetic leg according to an arrest report filed by the Myrtle Beach Police Department More Story continues,michigan university profs to fight off school shooters with hockey pucks This is a bad bet This does not happen As a kid playing hockey in Sweden the first thing you want to do is watch a movie about how kids kill their enemies Watch what makes your life miserable Then play a movie about how to have fun together while still watching hockey on big screen and being afraid of your teammates But hockey is hockey with some,a student at oakland university in auburn hills mich last month He took home from his tuition after student debt soared AP PhotoMatt Schlapp By Tom Ligtrya CHICAGO AP The federal government says it will allow a high school student to get free tuition while waiting despite the cost of a year spent studying in a foreign country The Associated Press reported Thursday that an AP study concluded,0
Another American community has been left reeling after a mass shooting with dead after a gunman opened fire at a western themed bar in Thousand Oaks California The shooting began late Wednesday night in the Borderline Bar Grill sending people diving under pool tables and other furniture for cover Witnesses and victims said that stools were thrown through windows to enable bar patrons to get away from the hail of bullets A college country music night was underway when the gunman dressed in black shot a security guard who was standing outside the bar before entering Witnesses suggested a smoke grenade may have been thrown The shooting comes less than two weeks after were gunned down at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania A number of members of congress swiftly called for new gun control legislation in the wake of the latest tragedy Such calls have had little effect in recent years Officials identified Ian David Long of nearby Newbury Park California as the suspected shooter Long was killed at the bar and police said he carried out the massacre with a legal calibre handgun that he had fitted with an extended magazine illegal in California He had apparently shot himself Its a horrific scene in there Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said Theres blood everywhere Long a yearold Marine veteran who may have been suffering from PTSD according to reports had purchased the rifle legally and burst into the bar at around pm He had driven his mothers car there and did not say anything before turning his weapon into the crowd according to witnesses Cole Knapp said he saw the gunman walk in and stop at the counter as if to pay Then Mr Knapp said heard gunfire and saw a young woman at the counter shot repeatedly It took a couple of seconds for people to realise what was going on and once that happened it was just utter chaos he told Reuters Knapp said he first helped people hide behind a pool table and then fled to the bars outdoor smoking patio where people were unaware of the shooting and urged them to run Story continues Police first began identifying victims of the Thousand Oaks attack less than hours after the gunmans last shot rang out including Sergeant Ron Helus a year veteran of the Ventura County Sheriffs Office In a press conference on Thursday Mr Dean praised the work of his office including the sacrifice from Mr Helus for working fast in response to the shooting at the packed college night bar At least five offduty law enforcement officers helped to protect people It could have been much much worse Mr Dean said on Thursday just a day before he was set to retire He added that he had been told there were to people in the bar which is popular with students Mr Dean said that his Sheriffs Office was mourning the loss of Mr Helus who was married and had a son The yearold had been with the force for nearly three decades and was close to retirement He went in there to save people and made the ultimate sacrifice Mr Dean said He noted that Mr Helus frequently talked to his wife during his shifts and had spoken with her shortly before he entered the bar Hey I have to go handle a call he was said to have told his wife I love you Ill talk to you later Cody Coffman was also killed according to his father Jason Mr Coffman broke down as he told reporters how his last words to his son as he went out that night were not to drink and drive and that he loved him He added Oh Cody I love you son The family of yearold Justin Meek who was also killed according to California Lutheran University president Chris Kimball said in a statement that Mr Meek heroically saved lives Another victim Alaina Housley was just and was a promising student at Pepperdine University with plans to study law her family said Adam Housley a former Fox News correspondent and Tamera MowryHousley an actress known for the s TV series Sister Sister said their niece was killed at the bar where she had gone line dancing with friends Other victims include Noel Sparks who was a youth camp leader and Moorpark College student The death was announced by United Methodist Church Westlake Village It is with heavy hearts that we notify you that Noel Sparks was among the victims of last nights shooting We grieve with Tony Sparks and Wendy Anderson the church said in a statement Daniel Manrique was a Marine veteran and focused on helping other veterans adjust to civilian life according to friends I have no doubt that he died a hero shielding others from gunshots He will forever be our hero son brother and the best uncle anybody could ever ask for Gladys Manrique Kosack a family member said Telemachus Orfanos was identified by his mother who said the he had survived the mass shooting in Las Vegas last year Jake Dunham and Blake Dingman both were identified by local Los Angeles outlet ABC Sean Adler a bouncer at the bar and former wrestling coach at Simi Valley High School perished in the California shooting and was remembered by the local wrestling community He was positive motivational and truly wanted the best for the people around him read a post on the Royal Wrestling Facebook page He was one of the victims last night at the shooting at Borderline Bar and Grill where he worked as a bouncer In response to the shooting president Donald Trump tweeted that he had been fully briefed on the incident and ordered federal flags at half staff to mourn the dead The shooter had served in the marines from until and was a machine gunner He had earned the rank of corporal in and had received other accolades including a Combat Action Ribbon and a Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal At an afternoon press conference police said it would be premature to speculate on any possible motive and are working to paint a picture of the mind of Long Officials did not have any comment on reports indicating the suspect may have suffered from PTSD Obviously he had something going on in his head that would cause him to do something like this Sheriff Dean had said earlier in the day Obviously he had some sort of issues Mr Dean told reporters that officers had gone to Longs home in nearby Newbury Park about four miles from the bar in April to answer a disturbance call and found him to be agitated Mental health specialists talked with Long and determined that no further action was necessary But in his southern California neighbourhood where he lived with his mother neighbours and police records shed some light on the life of the decorated combat veteran of the Afghanistan war Long had several interactions with police over the years and a neighbour said that the entire neighbourhood was aware of the issues and that his mother had been frustrated that her son was not seeking help Richard Berge one of those neighbours told USA Today that he had become friendly with the mother after offering to care for the familys German shepherds He had not been inside the Long house but told that newspaper another neighbour had seen walls full of holes which appeared to have been caused by kicking Long had been the victim of a battery at a local bar in Thousand Oaks and had been involved in two traffic incidents Deputies were once called to his house last year as a result of a domestic dispute and found that Long was acting somewhat irate and acting irrationally Police said they are still processing the Longs vehicle and home and are not yet disclosing any possible evidence they uncovered California governorelect Gavin Newsom who won the governors race on Tuesday made clear that change needs to

FILE In this April file photo President Donald Trump speaks during the National Rifle AssociationILA Leadership Forum in Atlanta As NRA prepares to gather for its th annual meeting in Dallas the political landscape has changed considerably in the past year Even with a GOPled Congress and a gunfriendly president in the White House its agenda has stalled And a new generation seems to have the upper hand in pushing for guncontrol after several deadly mass shootings AP PhotoMike Stewart File WASHINGTON AP Back for a return engagement President Donald Trumps address to the National Rifle Association on Friday comes after he temporarily strayed from the groups strong opposition to tougher gun controls following the school shooting in Parkland Florida only to rapidly return to the fold For the fourth year in a row Trump will speak to the group which meets this year in Dallas Last year he became the first sitting president to appear in more than years declaring that the assault on the Second Amendment had ended But this years speech comes as the issue of gun violence takes on new urgency after one of the deadliest school shootings in US history Student survivors of the Feb shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left people dead are now leading a massive national gun control movement While the shooting has not led to major changes from the White House or the Republicanled Congress it did at least briefly prompt Trump to declare that he would stand up to the powerful gun lobby He later backpedaled on that tough talk Trumps attendance at this years NRA convention was announced just days ago and came after Vice President Mike Pence already was scheduled to appear Asked why Trump was attending given the current political tensions around gun violence White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said this week that safety was a big priority But she added We also support the Second Amendment and strongly support it and dont see there to be a problem with speaking at the National Rifle Associations meeting Trump has long enjoyed strong backing from the NRA which spent about million in support of his presidential campaign The NRA showcased its highprofile guests for the event with NRA Executive Director Chris Cox saying on Twitter We are honored to celebrate American Freedom with Mike Pence and others But one of the Parkland student survivors David Hogg was critical of Trumps planned attendance Its kind of hypocritical of him to go there after saying so many politicians bow to the NRA and are owned by them Hogg said It proves that his heart and his wallet are in the same place During a televised gun meeting with lawmakers in late February Trump wagged his finger at a Republican senator and scolded him for being afraid of the NRA declaring that he would stand up to the group and finally get results in quelling gun violence He praised members of the gun lobby as great patriots but declared that doesnt mean we have to agree on everything It doesnt make sense that I have to wait until Im to get a handgun but I can get this weapon at He was referring to the AR the Parkland shooting suspect is accused of using Those words rattled some Republicans in Congress and sparked hope among guncontrol advocates that unlike after previous mass shootings tougher regulations would be enacted this time But Trump later retreated on those words expressing support for modest changes to the background check system as well as arming teachers After expressing interest in increasing the minimum age to purchase a socalled assault weapon to Trump later declared there was not much political support for the move He then pushed off the issue of age restrictions by assigning the question to a commission Trumps moves have drawn concerns from both sides of the gun debate He ran as supposedly the best friend of the Second Amendment and has become gun grabber in chief said Michael Hammond legislative counsel to the Gun Owners of America Hammond said his members were upset Trump had approved a spending bill that included background check updates Were not confident at all We are very disappointed Kristin Brown of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said Trump had offered mixed messages since the Parkland shooting Which Donald Trump is going to show up she asked Will it be the one who sympathized with the

Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldnt lose voters When thencandidate Donald Trump raised his hand to imitate firing a pistol he couldnt have known that a mass shooting at a Parkland Florida high school would turn his bravado into shame Today his bragging performance something no thinking candidate would ever say and do is a haunting reminder of his failure as a politician a president and a human being At other moments he stressed that he was so rich that he couldnt be bought by campaign donors which meant that only he could act on the nations behalf without yielding to special interest pressure Now in the days after Parkland when a response independent of special interest pressure is greatly needed the President cannot deliver Were he really the man he promised to be during the campaign he would have been free to advocate any policy However during the campaign he benefited from help by the NRA to the tune of million nearly million to support Trump and almost million against Hillary Clinton and voters who listen to the organization supported him Thus when he sat down with grieving survivors of Parkland and other shootings he was burdened like any other politician who tries to make common cause with ties to a special interest group With dry eyes and little apparent emotion Trump offered the idea of adding more guns to schools by arming teachers Trump won a job that requires some of the virtues he advertised and many more including the ability to set ego aside to unite a diverse and disparate people At his first opportunity to do so his inaugural speech Trump showed he didnt possess this quality as he claimed to be taking office at a time of American carnage and appealed only to the loyalists who he thought would let him shoot someone on Fifth Avenue With his first serious order which attempted to close Americas borders to people coming from certain Muslim majority countries Trump showed he would use his special powers independence and the strength of his base to pursue unpopular ends through means that many including some federal judges found questionable Time and again Trump demonstrated that his doitmyway ego and not some special gift for leadership was driving his presidency Confronted with the fact of Russias effort to influence our election and degrade our democracy he has cozied up to Vladimir Putin Challenged by a troubled immigration system that has left many socalled Dreamers in limbo he created a crisis by moving to end DACA and then failing to craft a real solution Given the opportunity to bring Americas infrastructure up to snuff he hasnt been able to make any real progress With every challenge Trump has had the opportunity to fulfill his promise to be the president he promised to be Time and again he either refused or failed to understand the actual power he possessed In between the ceremonies where he signed documents with a flourish Trump could have fashioned bipartisan majorities to enact policies most Americans favor Nowhere is this more true than it is in the area of gun violence Repeated polls have found that a majority of Democrats and Republicans supports background checks for every gun purchase barring people on the nofly list from purchasing guns a federal database to track all gun sales and a ban on assaultstyle rifles JUST WATCHED Trump shifts tone at CPAC Replay More

a kind of superpower that would enable him to defend the nation heal partisan divides create coalitions and generally Make America Great Again But by forming an alliance with the NRA President Trump would have to rely on some other qualities to act with the kind of strength he claims to possess Unfortunately even he seems to know that he is deficient Study the notes written on a card the

President Donald Trump on Saturday stated that the mass shooting at a Pennsylvania synagogue had little to do with gun control laws suggesting the results would have been far better if there had been protection inside This is a case where if they had an armed guard inside they would have been able to stop them Trump told reporters before departing for the Future Farmers of America convention in Indianapolis Maybe there would have been nobody killed except for him frankly he added referring to the shooter A gunman shot three police officers when he opened fire at the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania as Saturday services began around am Eastern time and killed people injuring six others Congregants at the synagogue located in the historically Jewish Pittsburgh neighborhood of Squirrel Hill had been observing a babynaming ceremony Trump demurred when asked whether he thought he could do anything to prevent future mass shootings The world is a violent world the president said Before I ran for office Id watch instances like this with churches and other things Id say What a shame what a shame he said adding that its even tougher when youre the president of the United States and you have to watch this kind of a thing happen Trump told reporters he is always in contact with the National Rifle Association one of the largest opponents of gun law reform Bowers will be charged with a hate crime under federal law Attorney General Jeff Sessions confirmed Saturday afternoon Referencing the shooter Trump also said lawmakers should stiffen up death penalty laws and bring capital punishment into vogue When people do this they should get the death penalty and shouldnt have to wait years and years he said Now the lawyers will get involved and everybodys going to get involved and well be years down the line I think they should stiffen up laws and I think they should very much bring the death penalty into vogue Story continues Vice President Mike Pence reiterated Trumps call for the death penalty at a Nevada campaign rally The president a staunch supporter of the death penalty infamously took out fullpage newspaper ads in reading Bring Back The Death Penalty to comment on a group of teens known as the Central Park Five The teens were wrongfully convicted of attacking a jogger Trump has also pushed for the use of armed guards as an effective deterrent to mass shooters going so far as to suggest some teachers be armed in schools Research suggests more guns is not the solution as many mass shooters do not expect to survive their shootings The presidents remarks stood in sharp contrast to those made by Pennsylvania Gov Tom Wolf D who issued a statement calling for action to prevent future mass shootings We must all pray and hope for no more loss of life But we have been saying this one is too many for far too long Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harms way Wolf said And in the aftermath of this tragedy we must come together and take action to prevent these tragedies in the future We cannot accept this violence as normal he added Former President Barack Obama also called for action writing on Twitter We have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun Several news outlets have identified the gunman as yearold Robert Bowers who is currently receiving medical treatment for multiple gunshot wounds He appears to be strongly antiSemitic Law enforcement sources told KDKA that Bowers walked into the synagogue and yelled All Jews must die before opening fire The gunman had an assaultstyle rifle and at least three handguns with him at the synagogue according to Bob Jones the FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh field office Jones a year veteran of the FBI said the synagogue was the most horrific crime scene hed ever seen on the job Trump once again condemned the attack as he addressed the Future Farmers of America convention in Indiana You wont think this would be possible in this day and age but we just dont seem to learn from the past Trump said Our minds cant comprehend the cruel hate and twisted malice that could cause a person to unleash such terrible violence during a babynaming ceremony He continued There must be no tolerance for antiSemitism in America or for any form of religious or racial hatred or prejudice While the

A federal judge in Seattle has put a temporary restraining order to halt the release of plans that would allow Americans to make Dprinted guns in the privacy of their homes The restraining order from US District Judge Robert Lasnik has put on hold a plan for people to be able to legally download blueprints to make the Dprinted guns starting Wednesday on hold There is a possibility of irreparable harm because of the way these guns can be made Lasnik said People were set to be able to legally download the Dprinted gun plans on Wednesday following a settlement reached by the company behind the plans the Texasbased nonprofit Defense Distributed and the federal government in June Gun control advocates say the decision by the government could result in the spread of unchecked untraceable and even undetectable firearms that can easily be constructed by anyone whether theyre legally allowed to own a gun or not If you buy a gun in America you go have to go through a background check Now anyone with a D printer in their living room can have a gun Avery Gardiner copresident of the Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence says Its going to make it easier for felons and fugitives who are deemed too dangerous to have guns to get guns She is also concerned some of the guns will be able to pass through metal detectors without setting them off D printing has been touted as a way to revolutionize manufacturing D printers turn digital files into threedimensional objects by successively laying down thin layers of plastic until the object is created The technology promises to allow almost anyone to create customdesigned parts quickly and cheaply using D printers that cost as little as hundreds or thousands of dollars Doctors are even experimenting with ways to D print organs But the technology is now drawing legal scrutiny for the ability to make unregistered firearms in the same way The governments decision on Dprinted gun plans comes after a threeyear legal battle between the US State Department and Cody Wilson the founder of Defense Distributed In Wilson posted plans for his Dprinted pistol The Liberator online The State Department ordered Wilson to take down the plans arguing that his post violated laws that regulate the export of firearms The department said online distribution of gun designs was a form of international distribution of weapons which falls under the State Departments purview Wilson sued the government in alleging that officials were violating his First Amendment right to free speech In June the State Department unexpectedly ended its legal battle with Wilson meaning he can share any blueprints he has According to the Second Amendment Foundation who filed the suit on behalf of Wilson the State Department settled because the Commerce Department is now in charge of firearm regulation and has jurisdiction over D printable gun blueprints Story continues Wilson says he plans to post his D printed gun plans when the State Departments prohibition ends on Wednesday Some politicians have already reacted to the State Department settlement expressing concern about the implications of widely available Dprinted weapon plans During a Senate hearing last week Sen Edward Markey a Massachusetts Democrat asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to reconsider the settlement citing the potential of guns getting into the hands of foreign terrorist groups You have my commitment Ill take a look at it Pompeo responded On Tuesday President Donald Trump weighed in tweeting I am looking into D Plastic Guns being sold to the public Already spoke to NRA doesnt seem to make much sense I am looking into D Plastic Guns being sold to the public Already spoke to NRA doesnt seem to make much sense Donald J Trump July Wilson tells TIME that he thinks claims about the security threats of Dprinted guns are exaggerated This is not new Homemade firearms have a always been a part American culture in my experience this is seen as a good thing he says But he concedes that some Dprinted guns are less detectable by traditional means like metal detectors Wilson believes D printing will end the gun control debate forever by making it possible for anyone anywhere to easily make guns without the governments involvement He also argues that posting Dprinted gun blueprints online is a matter of freedom of speech Wilsons Liberator is a singleshot pistol made of ABS plastic the material used for Legos It includes a metal firing pin and a piece of metal to ensure it doesnt run afoul of the Undetectable Firearms Act Wilson has also developed parts for semiautomatic weapons including the AR that will be available for download All visitors have to do is pay a small fee and enter their email to create an account on Defense Distributeds website No proof of age or permit is necessary to access the gun plans Gun control groups and some states are working to stop Wilson from making his plans for Dprinted gun available On Monday eight states sued the federal government in an attempt to force the Trump Administration to reinstate the ban On Saturday a federal judge denied an appeal from gun control groups Everytown for Gun Safety the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence to block Wilson from publishing the blueprints On July Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro sued in US District Court and successfully blocked access to Dprinted gun blueprints in the state Defense Distributed has agreed to block Pennsylvanians from accessing the website for now Of course techsavvy internet users could likely use various software tools to get around any statebased geographical restrictions Wilson has vowed to fight the efforts to block his Dprinted gun plans and has already taken legal action against New Jersey and Los Angeles for trying to stop him But he believes the spread of Dprinted weapons is inevitable We all understand theres no reversing digital advances Americans deserve to have access to this data its not honest to hide it he says,dprinted guns are unchecked and untraceable and a judge blocked them at the last minute The ACLU has filed a lawsuit against the ATF and Justice Department to overturn its decision,a dprinted gun from defense districting This is an example of a weapon that might have the potential to become a more lethal weapon if law enforcement had to use it to their advantage see below Some firearms with a fixed barrel function as well see below but I feel that such a system is best when combined with tactical

Years before he killed two women at a yoga studio in Tallahassee Florida Scott Beierle was posting YouTube videos in which he called women sluts and whores and talked about ripping their heads off Beierle who killed himself on Friday after killing Nancy Van Vessem and Maura Binkley and wounding five others at Hot Yoga Tallahassee had filmed several virulently misogynist videos in according to David Mack Amber Jamieson and Julia Reinstein of BuzzFeed News He had also uploaded sexist and violent songs to Soundcloud in the last few months In the videos Beierle rants about women who canceled dates or gave him their phone numbers even though they had boyfriends He also mentions Elliot Rodger the gunman who killed six people and wounded in Isla Vista California in and who has become a hero to men who identify as incels short for involuntary celibate The Tallahassee shooting was the third crime in a single week that was apparently preceded by a trail of online hate Robert Bowers the man suspected of killing people and wounding six others in a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue last Saturday appears to have posted threatening language about Jewish people and HIAS National Refugee Shabbat a refugee aid group formerly known as the Hebrew Immigration Aid Society on Gab a social network that has become a home for antiSemitism and racism Cesar Sayoc the man arrested last Friday in connection with bombs mailed to CNN and several critics of President Donald Trump appears to have threatened Democrats on Twitter and Facebook Hug your loved sonNiecewife family real close everytime U walk out your home said one tweet sent to former Vice President Joe Biden apparently by Sayoc It included an image of Bidens home with a target superimposed on it The postings apparently made by Beierle Bowers and Sayoc were part of a pattern going back years Elliot Rodger left behind a YouTube video in which he said women would be punished for not being attracted to him And George Sodini a gunman whose murder of three women at a gym outside Pittsburgh in appears to share similarities with the Tallahassee shooting maintained a blog detailing his anger toward women for months before committing the crime These men share more than their apparent online histories of bigotry All were part of communities online or off that seemed to reinforce their views Thats why online hatred and harassment is so serious Its not just that an individual persons online posts can be warning signs of future violence Its also that hateful posts even by those who never commit crimes create an environment where those crimes are encouraged accepted and even celebrated Many mass murderers and other criminals have left behind an online trail Beierles YouTube and SoundCloud history is rife with violent sexism In one video he says of a woman who canceled dates with him I could have ripped her head off according to BuzzFeed In a song called Locked in My Basement he describes holding a woman prisoner and raping her He mentions Rodger in a video called Plight of the Adolescent Male saying Id like to send a message now to the adolescent males that are in the position the situation the disposition of Elliot Rodger of not getting any no love no nothing This endless wasteland that breeds this longing and this frustration That was me certainly as an adolescent Beierle had also been arrested in and for grabbing womens buttocks without their consent according to the Tallahassee Democrat Meanwhile posts apparently by Robert Bowers the alleged Pittsburgh assailant reveal a history of antiSemitism and a web of influences On Gab someone by the name of Robert Bowers posted a variety of antiSemitic slurs and statements including jews are the children of satan according to the Associated Press The same user criticized President Trump for being insufficiently antiJewish and bragged about his gun collection calling it his glock family and saying one gun in particular had an amazing trigger As Voxs Jane Coaston notes Gab was started as a free speech alternative to Twitter and allows forms of hate speech that are banned on more mainstream social networks Because of this its become a gathering place and recruitment forum for neoNazi groups One post from a group called Atomwaffen Division features swastikas racial slurs and the invitation Join your local Nazis The synagogue shooting suspect also acted out of a specific kind of antiSemitism as Voxs Dara Lind points out blaming Jews in America for bringing in an invasion of nonwhite immigrants who would slaughter the white race This particular kind of bigotry has been fueled by Trumps claims that his political opponents are at fault for the caravan of migrants approaching the US and by antiSemitic conspiracy theorists on Gab and other social networks who have cast the caravan as a Jewish invasion Most of the people posting this theory online have never committed antiSemitic violence but they helped create the conditions under which something like the Pittsburgh shooting could occur Twitter and Facebook accounts connected to Sayoc contain threats against Biden and former Attorney General Eric Holder both of whom received pipe bombs CNN analyst Phil Mudd also received a Twitter threat apparently from Sayoc Political analyst Rochelle Ritchie reported a threat apparently from Sayoc to Twitter in the days before the shooting but Twitter did not take action Sayoc was apparently a devotee of a variety of conspiracy theories many of which have spread on Twitter As Voxs German Lopez points out he often posted criticisms of liberal billionaire George Soros a common target of antiSemitic fearmongering on Twitter and elsewhere Trump has fanned the flames of this fearmongering retweeting a claim earlier this year that Soros was a nazi who turned in his fellow Jews Beierle Bowers and Sayoc were far from alone in leaving what appear to be online trails pointing to future violent behavior Tomorrow is the day of retribution Rodger said in his last YouTube video according to the New York Times For the last eight years of my life ever since I hit puberty Ive been forced to endure an existence of loneliness rejection and unfulfilled desires Girls gave their affection and sex and love to other men but never to me I do not know why you girls arent attracted to me he added But I will punish you all for it Rodger also identified as an incel and posted on forums populated by men with similar frustrations The yearold who took his own life after killing others became something of a hero to other incels as Voxs Zack Beauchamp has noted A man who killed people by driving a van down a Toronto street in April identified himself on Facebook as part of the Incel Rebellion Also on Facebook he praised the Rodger calling him the Supreme Gentleman a nickname Rodger had chosen for himself The man who shot and killed three women at a Pittsburgh gym meanwhile wrote on his personal website in I dress good am cleanshaven bathe touch of cologne yet million women rejected me over an or year period A man needs a woman for confidence he added He gets a boost on the job career with other men and everywhere else when he knows inside he has someone to spend the night with and who is also a friend This type of life I see is a closed world with me specifically and totally excluded He also had ties to the pickup artist community having purchased the book How to Date Young Women For Men Over and appearing in a video of one of author R Don Steeles lectures Pickup artistry more in vogue in the early s than it is now sometimes treated women as less human than men as targets to be coerced or fooled into sex Its not murder of course but this was the climate of misogyny in which he planned his crime Fighting hate crimes means understanding the communities that support them Each of these men may have seemed like a loner but in fact each was part of a group of people with similarly toxic views directed at Jewish people women or people of color And we need to understand crimes like the Tallahassee and Pittsburgh shootings and the mailing of pipe bombs to Democrats within their larger context of on and offline hate That means holding platforms accountable for the behavior they allow In the wake of the pipe bombings Twitter has apologized for not taking Ritchies report more seriously We are investigating what happened and will continue to work to improve how we handle concerns raised by anyone on Twitter the account tweeted last week But in response to a request for specifics from The Verge the company merely pointed to blog posts from earlier in the year This is a familiar story from Twitter the Verges Andrew Liptak writes apologizing for reacting
